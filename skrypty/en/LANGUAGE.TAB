ATLH302	...God of the Volcano who resides in Mount Acidophilus...
ATLH303	...Accept this sacrifice we make unto you...
ATLH304	...in the form of flesh with high amounts of fiber and wholesome cellulose...
ATLH305	...free of all fat and trans-fatty acids...
ATLH306	...so that it might nourish you and bring your favor upon our humble village...
ATLH307	...and not upset nor agitate your Ulcerative Caldera...
ATLH308	Okay boys... toss 'im in!
ATLH309	You've been a wonderful audience! Thank you and good night!
ATLH310	You fool! You've given cheese to a lactose intolerant volcano god!
ATLH311	Do you know what that means? You've brought about the Coming of the Divine Dysentery!
ATLH312	Run for your lives!
ATGT313	Wow! That was more spectacular than I had hoped!
ATLH314	Hey!
ATLH315	Get out of here!
ATLH316	You'll spoil the ceremony!
ATGT317	You feed the volcano mannequins made from vegetables?
ATLH318	Yes we do.
ATLH319	Sherman isn't a strict vegetarian...
ATLH320	...but fatty foods can cause him severe indigestion.
ATGT321	Nice day for a sacrifice.
ATLH322	Only one a day. Sherman is sensitive to over-feeding.
ATNZ323	sacrifice
ATNZ324	massive seething caldera
ATGT325	Bubbly.
ATGT326	I'd lose my hand in that!
ATGT327	Hail, hail the god of the volcano!
ATGT328	It wouldn't make a suitable sacrifice.
ATNZ329	massive seething caldera
ATNZ330	Lemonhead
ATGT331	It's the leader of the cannibals.
ATGT332	I don't want to throw HIM into the volcano.
AGSO301	Stand aside or I'll strike you down!
AGSO302	Hi there, neighbor! Got any diamonds?
AGSO303	So, where's this huge diamond you guys are supposed to have?
AGSO304	Good afternoon. I'm the new Skull Island diamond inspector...
AGSO305	I have got SO much money it's almost embarrassing.
AGSO306	Whoops! I must have the wrong cave. Later!
AGCR307	Grrr...
AGGT308	Err... I'll strike you down with how polite and reasonable I can be.
AGKA309	We seem to have an unwanted visitor, Cruff. Deal with him.
AGGT310	Darn. Let me try that again.
AGGT311	Wouldn't you know but I'm fresh out!
AGKA312	Go away.
AGGT313	Darn. Let me try that again.
AGCR314	Grrr...
AGKA315	Have at him, Cruff.
AGGT316	Darn. Let me try that again.
AGGT317	I'm going to have to see every diamond you've got. Every last one.
AGGT318	Come on, people! Chop chop! I don't have all day!
AGKA319	I do not like this man. Kill him.
AGGT320	Darn. Let me try that again.
AGKA321	Well, hello! Let's talk, Mister ahhh...?
AGSO322	Threepwood. Guybrush Threepwood.
AGSO323	LeChuck. Zombie Pirate LeChuck.
AGSO324	Goodsoup. Wonton Goodsoup.
AGSO325	Loogie. Captain Loogie.
AGSO326	VanGoughderfassenson. Jethro VanGoughderfassenson.
AGSO327	Tito. Just Tito.
AGKA328	Very well, Mister Threepwood...
AGGT329	Hey! How did you know my...
AGKA330	It is my BUSINESS to know who enters and who leaves Skull Island.
AGKA331	I am King André, and this is my associate Cruff.
AGKA332	Were you looking for something in particular?
AGGT333	The Goodsoup family diamond.
AGGT334	LeChuck stole it, you bought it, I want it. Now.
AGCR335	Grrr...
AGGT336	Please.
AGGT337	Sir.
AGKA338	But we have so much quality merchandise here at the Pirates' Club!
AGCR339	Our prices get lower every day.
AGKA340	Everything a pirate -- or pirate in training -- could possibly want is here...
AGKA341	...for the right price.
AGKA342	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
AGSO343	I don't get it.
AGSO344	Could you not laugh like that anymore?
AGSO345	You're such an odd person.
AGSO346	You're evading the whole diamond issue.
AGKA347	The Goodsoup diamond is the centerpiece of my collection...
AGKA348	...the fantastic energy flowing through it is the key to all my power!
AGGT349	So can I have it?
AGKA350	Of course you can't have it... unless you were to give something in return.
AGSO351	Do you expect me to talk?
AGSO352	Your evil plan will never work, André!
AGSO353	You're a madman!
AGSO354	That diamond belongs in a museum!
AGSO355	Maybe we could make a deal.
AGSO356	Maybe I'll just take a look around.
AGGT357	Maybe I'll just take a look around.
AGKA358	No, Mister Threepwood! I expect you to buy!
AGKA359	But it is flawless!
AGKA360	A carefully-placed series of charges laid throughout Blood Island...
AGKA361	...all controlled by a network of satellites in a geosynchronous orbit...
AGKA362	...and only one man has access to the master switch.
AGCR363	Uh, boss?
AGKA364	I am that man, Threepwood, and...
AGCR365	Boss?
AGKA366	Yes, Mister Cruff?
AGCR367	Ix-nay on the evil an-play.
AGKA368	Ah, yes. Of course.
AGKA369	Am I mad? Am I?
AGKA370	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
AGKA371	Is it madness to sit in a cave at the top of a deserted island...
AGKA372	...accumulating vast amounts of gold and jewels and stuffed animals...
AGKA373	...stockpiling plunder from across the Caribbean and passing the savings on to you?
AGKA374	Is that madness? Or GENIUS?!?
AGGT375	Good point. I take it back.
AGKA376	I'm not crazy -- my prices are!
AGKA377	So do Postimpressionist paintings, Mister Threepwood.
AGKA378	So do Postimpressionist paintings.
AGGT379	What the heck is THAT supposed to mean?
AGKA380	One day... you will understand.
AGSO381	I couldn't help noticing those adorable Smuggle-Bunnies...
AGSO382	I'd like to buy something really piratey.
AGSO383	How about toys? Do you have any toys?
AGSO384	I really had my heart set on that diamond.
AGSO385	Okay, I'll play you for the diamond.
AGSO386	I want to play for the diamond again.
AGSO387	I'm still looking, thanks.
AGKA388	Ahhh, the Smuggle Bunny! One of our most popular items.
AGKA389	Each one comes with a cleverly-hidden pouch just above the small intestine.
AGGT390	Great! I'll take one!
AGKA391	None of them contains the diamond.
AGGT392	Oh. Never mind.
AGKA393	Of course. Really piratey things are, of course, our specialty.
AGKA394	Can I interest you in a peg leg?
AGGT395	That depends on what you do with it.
AGGT396	That was a joke.
AGKA397	Ah. Yes. I don't quite follow you, but I'm sure it was amusing.
AGKA398	As you wish.
AGKA399	You are a formidable opponent, Mister Threepwood...
AGKA400	...but it looks as if our game of cat and mouse must cease.
AGKA401	It is a perfect diamond, one of the largest I've ever seen.
AGGT402	I'll take it!
AGKA403	And so it comes with a very large price.
AGGT404	Enough with the hard sell. How much?
AGKA405	It will cost you an awful lot of money.
AGKA406	Do you have that much?
AGGT407	Well, I have a lot of money.
AGCR408	Ha! Not enough.
AGKA409	My partner is right.
AGKA410	We can't give it to you for anything less than an awful lot of money.
AGGT411	Uh, no.
AGCR412	How much you got?
AGGT413	Well, let me think...
AGGT414	...the cash on me... my mutual fund... carry the two...
AGGT415	...very little.
AGKA416	As I thought.
AGKA417	But perhaps we could make a deal.
AGKA418	My partner and I are very fond of cards. Poker, in particular.
AGKA419	How about a little wager? If you can defeat us at poker, you win the diamond.
AGGT420	Sounds fair.
AGKA421	Yes. Fair.
AGKA422	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
AGGT423	Could you stop laughing like that? It's very unnerving.
AGKA424	So, Mister Threepwood. The question is to you:
AGKA425	Care to join us in a game of cards?
AGSO426	Sounds fun! Deal me in, baldy!
AGSO427	No way. I'm terrible at poker.
AGKA428	You will have to pay to enter the game.
AGGT429	Well, how much do I need?
AGCR430	Not very much.
AGKA431	Put up your side of the wager, Mister Threepwood.
AGGT432	I don't have any money.
AGKA433	Then you can't play.
AGKA434	What if by some unfortunate turn of luck you happened to lose?
AGKA435	We would have nothing to gain.
AGGT436	Sure, I can handle that.
AGGT437	This is a lot of money. I'd better only give them part of it.
AGKA438	Have you ever played poker before, Mister Threepwood?
AGGT439	No! Would you believe this is my very first time?
AGCR440	Heh. Heh.
AGKA441	Then I'll give you a brief explanation.
AGKA442	The game is the simplest variety of Five-Card stud.
AGKA443	I deal five cards to each of us.
AGKA444	We show our cards to each other, and the player with the best hand wins.
AGGT445	How do I know what makes the best hand?
AGKA446	If you have any questions, just ask us.
AGKA447	You do trust us, don't you?
AGSO448	About as far as I can throw you, you lowlife crook.
AGSO449	Trust you? No chance, you filthy liar.
AGSO450	I trust that you both are the lowest scum of society.
AGSO451	You don't know the meaning of trust, you thief.
AGGT452	Of course I trust you!
AGKA453	Very well. Let us begin.
AGGT454	Come on, sevens!
AGGT455	Good cards! Daddy needs to lift a pirate curse!
AGGT456	No whammies! No whammies!
AGGT457	dealer dealer dealer dealer SWING dealer!
AGKA458	Take a moment to look at your cards.
AGKA459	Leaving so soon, Mister Threepwood?
AGCR460	Siddown! We're playing here.
AGKA461	Giving up, Guybrush?
AGSO462	I was just stretching my legs! I want to keep playing.
AGSO463	Keep my money. I got plenty. I give up.
AGKA464	Maybe your luck will improve.
AGKA465	Don't give up just yet.
AGKA466	Perhaps you should try again.
AGKA467	Would you care to try again?
AGSO468	You bet. I'm going to win that diamond!
AGSO469	No, thanks.

ADRH412	Look who's washed up on my deck.
ADRH413	What do you want, Mr. Thropwimp?
ADSO414	I'm Guybrush Threepwood! A mighty pirate!
ADSO415	I've come to settle the score!
ADSO416	You'll never get away with this, René!
ADSO417	I have you now!
ADSO418	Oooh, are you gonna get it!
ADSO419	I've come for my map!
ADSO420	Give me my map, you fiend!
ADSO421	Hand over that map, or taste my sword!
ADSO422	I mean to run you through, just the same!
ADSO423	I've come to plunder your treasure!
ADSO424	Give me your treasure and I'll let you live!
ADSO425	Yer treasure or yer life!

ADRH435	Hmmm.
ADRH436	This may prove amusing.
ADRH437	I've nothing to fear from you, urchin!
ADRH438	I shall dispatch you presently.

ADO4472	I'll see you clapped in irons, first!
ADO5473	I'll see you clapped in irons, first!
ADO6474	I'll see you clapped in irons, first!
ADSU475	Every enemy I've met I've annihilated!
ADSU476	You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.
ADSU477	Killing you would be justifiable homicide!
ADSU478	You're the ugliest monster ever created!
ADSU479	I'll skewer you, like a sow at a buffet!
ADSU480	Would you like to be buried or cremated?
ADSU481	When your father first saw you, he must have been mortified.
ADSU482	I'll leave you devastated, mutilated and perforated.
ADSU483	I have never seen such clumsy swordplay.
ADSU484	Heaven preserve me! You look like something that's died!
ADSU485	I'll hound you night and day!
ADSU486	I can't rest 'til you've been exterminated!
ADSU487	En garde! Touché!
ADSU488	Throughout the Caribbean, my great deeds are celebrated.
ADSU489	Coming face to face with me must leave you petrified!
ADSU490	You can't match my witty repartee!
ADSU491	My attacks have left entire islands depopulated!
ADSU492	You have the sex appeal of a Shar-Pei.
ADSU493	When I'm done, your body will be rotted and putrefied!
ADSU494	Your looks would make pigs nauseated.
ADSU495	Your lips look like they belong on the catch of the day.
ADSU496	I give you a choice. You can be gutted, or decapitated!
ADSU497	You're a disgrace to your species, you're so undignified!
ADSU498	I can't tell which of my traits has you the most intimidated.
ADSU499	I have never lost a mêlée!
ADSU500	Nothing on this earth can save your sorry hide!
ADSU501	You'll find I'm dogged and relentless to my prey!
ADSU502	Your stench would make an outhouse cleaner irritated!
ADSU503	Your mother wears a toupee!
ADSU504	My skills with a sword are highly venerated.
ADSU505	Never before have I faced someone so sissified.
ADSU506	Nothing can stop me from blowing you away!
ADSU507	You're ugly!
ADSU508	You're stupid!
ADRP509	With your breath, I'm sure they all suffocated.
ADRP510	I look THAT much like your fiancée?
ADRP511	Then killing you must be justifiable fungicide.
ADRP512	If you don't count all the ones you've dated.
ADRP513	When I'm done with YOU, you'll be a boneless fillet.
ADRP514	With you around, I'd prefer to be fumigated.
ADRP515	At least mine can be identified.
ADRP516	Your odor alone makes me aggravated, agitated and infuriated.
ADRP517	You would have, but you were always running away.
ADRP518	The only way you'll be preserved is in formaldehyde.
ADRP519	Then be a good dog. Sit! Stay!
ADRP520	Then perhaps you should switch to decaffeinated.
ADRP521	Oh, that is so cliché!
ADRP522	Too bad they're all fabricated.
ADRP523	Is that your face? I thought it was your backside.
ADRP524	I could, if you would use some breath spray.
ADSU525	A dip in the pool would leave me invigorated!
ADSU526	Healthy fats are polyunsaturated.
ADSU527	I feel our water should be fluoridated.
ADSU528	I think the cost of my sword should be rebated.
ADSU529	I had my cat laminated!
ADSU530	I set my blender to frappe.
ADSU531	Know what I never get tired of? Water ballet.
ADSU532	This floor is just lovely. Is it parquet?
ADSU533	In case of an earthquake, stand in a doorway.
ADSU534	Instead of skip, I'd rather sashay.
ADSU535	I like my steak chicken-fried!
ADSU536	I sent a letter to the King of Portugal, who never replied.
ADSU537	Hydraulic suspension guarantees a nice smooth ride.
ADSU538	I found a three-dollar bill, but I don't think it was bona fide.
ADSU539	Puppies and kittens always get me teary-eyed.
ADSU540	The wood paneling on my ship is simulated!
ADSU541	You'll digest food better if it's been masticated.
ADSU542	I was thrown off a subway because I had expectorated.
ADSU543	We had a little league team, but I never participated.
ADSU544	I'd like the Latin verb `to go` conjugated.
ADSU545	A dentifrice helps prevent tooth decay!
ADSU546	The Caribbean is in such a state of disarray.
ADSU547	Whoo! Do I enjoy macramé!
ADSU548	I tend to use a lot of hair spray.
ADSU549	I think that my sister's in a family way.
ADSU550	Better keep that refrigerated!
ADSU551	The importance of breakfast cannot be overstated.
ADSU552	These swordfights need to be officiated.
ADSU553	This isn't going as well as I'd anticipated.
ADSU554	Could I get my parking ticket validated?
ADSU555	With iron and vitamins it's been fortified!
ADSU556	Dinoflagellates are the cause of red tide.
ADSU557	It pays to keep a glass of water at your bedside.
ADSU558	I carry traveler's cheques that are accepted worldwide.
ADSU559	I don't care for tomatoes unless they're sun-dried.
ADSU560	Let's get these sausages hot-plated!
ADSU561	I think pirates in training often feel alienated.
ADSU562	My craving for peanuts will never be satiated!
ADSU563	Chinese food's best when not monosodium-glutamated.
ADSU564	My entire wardrobe is color-coordinated.
ADSU565	Oslo is the capital of Norway.
ADSU566	My brother is working on a screenplay.
ADSU567	Plan for your future with an IRA.
ADSU568	Of all crafts, my favorite is papier-mâché.
ADSU569	I'll meet you in the foyer!
ADSU570	Can you go cross-eyed?
ADSU571	I can't wait until our tax forms are simplified.
ADSU572	Well, I'm fit to be tied!
ADSU573	If you're planning on retiring, have money set aside.
ADSU574	My ship has barnacles on its underside.

ADO11040	I have no use for that. I'm a faith healer, I am.
ADO21041	I have no use for that. I'm a faith healer, I am.
ADO31042	I have no use for that. I'm a faith healer, I am.
ADO41043	I have no use for that. I'm a faith healer, I am.
ADO51044	I have no use for that. I'm a faith healer, I am.
ADO61045	I have no use for that. I'm a faith healer, I am.
ADGT1046	...but can I keep my copy of `Art of the Vichyssoise`?
ADO11047	Aye, I hate cold soup.
ADO21048	Aye, I hate cold soup.
ADO31049	Aye, I hate cold soup.
ADO41050	Aye, I hate cold soup.
ADO51051	Aye, I hate cold soup.
ADO61052	Aye, I hate cold soup.
ADGT1053	I haven't got any treasure.
ADGT1054	Why do you think I was attacking you?
ADGT1055	If I had any, you'd be the first one to get it.
ADO11056	Arr...
ADO21057	Arr...
ADO31058	Arr...
ADO41059	Arr...
ADO51060	Arr...
ADO61061	Arr...
ADGT1062	Treasure?
ADGT1063	You wanted treasure?
ADGT1064	I'm sorry, I'm fresh out.
ADGT1065	If I had treasure, don't you think I'd spend it before grappling with the likes of you?
ADO11066	Aye, I suppose you would. Never mind then.
ADO21067	Aye, I suppose you would. Never mind then.
ADO31068	Aye, I suppose you would. Never mind then.

ARKN301	Back again, Mister?
ARGT302	Well, well, well.
ARKN303	Welcome to Cap'n Kenny's Emporium O' Merry Arms!
ARKN304	What can I do for you today, Matey ?
ARNZ305	The Sea Cucumber
ARNZ306	huge pile of cannons
ARGT307	Kenny's blocked the way into town with this big pile of cannons.
ARGT308	I couldn't lift those.
ARNZ309	Kenny
ARGT310	It's that bratty lemonade salesman, but he's selling cannons now.
BJVH301	What's the matter Brush Boy?
BJVH302	Can't you keep up?
BJGT303	I'm sorry. I just lost myself in the beauty of the melody.
BJGT304	I just got a cramp, that's all!
BJVH305	Would you like to try again?
BJVH306	Wait!
BJVH307	Stop!
BJVH308	That last note was wrong!
BJVH309	I win!
BJVH310	I WIN!
BJVH311	Wooowooowooo!
BJVH312	Yessssss!
BJVH313	You lose!
BJVH314	Oh! I am so good!
BJGT315	What a sore winner.
BJVH316	Once again I have proved you unfit to be my captain!
BJVH317	Want to try again?
BJSO318	Sure. I'm just getting warmed up.
BJSO319	No.
BJVH320	Fine!
BJVH321	Quitter.
BJVH322	I'll just clear my stuff out of here.
BCCB301	IT'S EL POLLO DIABLO!
BCCB302	KILL HIM!
BCGT303	May I please have some of your oil?
BCCB304	That oil is solely for the use of the fry-station technician.
BCGT305	Nice, fluffy towel.
BCNN306	dry towel
BCGT307	I'll just take one more.
BCNN308	dry towels
BCGT309	I've got enough towels.
BCCB310	Youch!
BCCB311	Pappapisshu!
BCGT312	Excuse me.
BCCB313	Yes, you filthy little man?
BCGT314	My card...
BCCB315	Well, I'm sure there must be some mistake.
BCCB316	You're slovenly!
BCGT317	And yet I have a membership card.
BCCB318	Let me see that!
BCCB319	This must've been approved the morning after the office Christmas party!
BCCB320	Oh, no!
BCCB321	In the name of all things clean!
BCCB322	You've got a membership!
BCGT323	Yes.
BCGT324	And I think I'll just take one of your fluffy, clean towels...
BCGT325	...and enjoy a nice, relaxing stroll down your beach.
BCCB326	NO!
BCCB327	YOU MUSTN'T!
BCSO328	I must. And perhaps I'll sunbathe nude.
BCSO329	Then perhaps I'll stay here and tell you my life story.
BCSO330	I just spent weeks on a raft without a toothbrush.
BCSO331	Quiet! The voices in my head are telling me something.
BCCB332	Sweet mother-of-pearl, no!
BCCB333	I thought it might be something like that.
BCCB334	Now that I think about it...
BCCB335	...it is nice out on the FAR end of the beach.
BCCB336	You should go there.
BCCB337	You should go there now.
BCNN338	Cabaña
BCGT339	I'd rather go around to the gate than go through that towel business again.
BCCB340	You can't go in there!
BCCB341	That's for members only!
BCNZ342	towels
BCGT343	This is a nice, dry, fluffy towel.
BCGT344	I have two nice, dry towels.
BCGT345	I have three towels.
BCGT346	That doesn't need drying.
BCGT347	I'm already dry.
BCNZ348	wet towels
BCGT349	This is an ice cold, wet towel.
BCGT350	I have two wet towels.
BCGT351	I have three wet towels.
BCGT352	A damp towel would be of no use here.
BCGT353	They feel ice cold.

BCGT355	It's an ice bucket for a bottle of sparkling grog.
BCNN356	wet towels
BCNN357	wet towel
BCGT358	This towel is soaking wet.
BCGT359	The towels are all wet now.
BCGT360	My tongue might stick. I'm not going to fall for that one again.
BCGT361	I don't want to carry that around. It's cold.
BCNZ362	cooking oil
BCGT363	It's coconut cooking oil.
BCGT364	That doesn't need cooking oil.
BCGT365	I need to know what to oil.
BCGT366	Mmm...Faux buttery goodness.
BCNZ367	cooking oil
BCCB368	That is only for the chef.
BCNZ369	cabaña boy
BCGT370	He's a member of the bustling Plunder Island workforce.
BCGT371	This guy is being a real wet blanket.
BCGT372	I don't want him looking at this card too closely.
BCGT373	A dry towel just doesn't have that same sting.
BCCB374	If you're trying to bribe me, it's not going to work.
BCGT375	There's got to be a way to settle this without bloodshed.
BCSQ376	I'm sorry for being rude. Please feel free to slap me, and then feel free to make full use of the club.
BCGT377	I don't mind if I do.
BCCB378	Not so fast!
BCGT379	Never mind.
BCCB380	If I wanted to be sick, I would just ask to see you in a swimsuit.

BCGT382	It's full of dirty dishes.

BCGT386	Nothing makes a day on the beach like a generous helping of greasy, deep-fried food.
BCGT387	That would hurt.
BCGT388	There's already way too much oil in the fryer.
BCNZ389	deep fryer

BCGT392	Yeellch, no. It looks like some of those are older than I am.

BCNZ394	towel hamper
BCGT395	It's full of dirty towels.
BCGT396	I think I've taken my share of the towels.
BCCB397	Those towels are for members only!
BCGT398	No. I'll keep it.
BCGT399	No. I'll keep them.
BCGT400	No. I'll keep it.
BCGT401	No. I'll keep them.
BHGT301	It's burning hot!
BHGT302	Whew!
BHGT303	Ouch!
BHGT304	Oooh!
BHGT305	Eeeh!
BHGT306	Ah!
BHGT307	Hot!
BHGT308	With these holes in my shoes I'll never get across that hot beach.
BHNN309	dry towel

BHGT311	Wow! That's one hot beach!

BHGT313	There's already a towel on the sand.

BDGT301	Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate.
BDBL302	So?
BDGT303	So... it's good to meet you, Mister...?
BDBL304	Bill.
BDGT305	Bill? That's your pirate name? Bill?
BDBL306	Cutthroat Bill.
BDGT307	Oh, I see. Well that puts a whole new spin on it, doesn't it?
BDNN308	Cutthroat Bill
BDSO309	Are you ever going to go back to pirating?
BDSO310	I am too a mighty pirate!
BDSO311	I bet I could find gold on this very island!
BDSO312	Are you sure you don't want to join my crew?
BDSO313	Are you ready to set sail for adventure?
BDSO314	How'd you break into the hairstyling industry?
BDSO315	Do you really enjoy being a barber?
BDSO316	Pirate stories. Got any?
BDSO317	What happened during that treasure hunt?
BDSO318	Did your crew ever find treasure?
BDSO319	Do you know any more pirate stories?
BDSO320	Say, uh, what are you eating there?
BDSO321	That's a really good jawbreaker there, huh?
BDSO322	Boy, I sure could go for a jawbreaker right about now.
BDSO323	You going to finish that jawbreaker?
BDSO324	Nothing I love more than a good jawbreaker!
BDSO325	Could I have your jawbreaker?
BDSO326	It's been a pleasure. Bye.
BDBL327	Maybe. Someday. If I find the right captain.
BDGT328	Perfect! I'll be your captain... onward to Blood Island and high adventure! Want to come?
BDBL329	You? A captain? Hardly.
BDSO330	I'm the mighty pirate who defeated LeChuck!
BDSO331	I defeated the Sword Master of Mêlée Island!
BDSO332	I discovered the treasure of Big Whoop!
BDSO333	I score excessively high on standardized tests!
BDSO334	I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
BDSO335	You're right. Sorry to bother you.
BDBL336	And what do you have to show for it?
BDGT337	I've got a ton of cool stories...
BDBL338	Treasure? Immense mounds of gold and diamonds? Solid gold scepters of power? Anything?
BDGT339	Well, I've got these nickels.
BDBL340	Wooden?
BDGT341	Err, yeah.
BDBL342	Some treasure hunter you are! You couldn't find gold in a jewelry shop.
BDSO343	I bet I could find gold on this very island!
BDSO344	I bet I could find more gold than you've ever seen!
BDSO345	I bet I could too, you big old bedwetting doody-head!
BDSO346	You're right. Sorry to bother ya.
BDBL347	How MUCH would you bet?
BDGT348	Well, I've got these nickels.
BDBL349	Right. Come back when you have some real treasure to show me.
BDBL350	You still haven't proven you can find anything of value.
BDBL351	Come back when you have some real treasure to show me.
BDBL352	Sure. Whatever. I'll meet you on your ship when you're ready.
BDBL353	I saw an ad to join a barbershop quartet. Got a problem with that?
BDGT354	No! That must be very rewarding work.
BDBL355	What's that supposed to mean?
BDGT356	Mean? Just that... you know, cutting hair, and, err, singing must be just... a lot of fun.
BDBL357	It's like a party every day.
BDBL358	Some days I just don't know how to contain my joy.
BDBL359	I get giddy and the laughter bubbles out of me like a sparkling fountain of mirth and gaiety.
BDGT360	Okay! New topic.
BDBL361	It's a steady income.
BDBL362	Okay, here's a story:
BDBL363	I started out as a crewman on The Raging Tightwad, sailing out of Puerto Pollo.
BDBL364	The captain was a master treasure hunter, a diviner from some ancient secret society.
BDBL365	He had some weird fifth sense when it came to finding objects of value.
BDSO366	Don't you mean sixth sense?
BDSO367	Supernatural powers? I have a hard time believing that.
BDSO368	Is this going to be scary?
BDSO369	Hey, that's something. I'll hear the rest later.
BDBL370	No, by some cruel trick of nature he was born without taste buds.
BDBL371	But his other senses took over and gave him an uncanny ability to find treasure.
BDBL372	I did, too... at first.
BDGT373	Because I warn you, I've been known to leap into the arms of total strangers when startled.
BDBL374	I have a razor.
BDGT375	Good point. (laugh) Please go on.
BDBL376	We left port without a map, guided only by the captain's keen senses.
BDBL377	We spent the first week going around in circles...
BDBL378	...until we realized the crew's gold earrings were throwing the captain off.
BDBL379	After we tossed all our jewelry, gold coins, and belt buckles overboard, we got back on course.
BDSO380	Did you ever find any treasure?
BDSO381	Your captain sounds like a real freak show.
BDSO382	How long is this story, anyway?
BDSO383	You'll have to finish this later, when I'm interested.
BDBL384	Many of us on board started to think the same thing.
BDBL385	Long enough. Shut your hole.
BDGT386	Will do!
BDBL387	We sailed for two years, and had finally started back to Plunder Island.
BDBL388	But just as we started to doubt him, he paid off. We found sunken treasure, right off the coast!
BDGT389	Wait a second... was it an enormous pile of jewelry and gold coins and belt buckles at the bottom of the bay?
BDBL390	Exactly! How did you know that?
BDGT391	Just had a feeling.
BDBL392	Want the story about how I slit the throat of the annoying little pirate who kept asking me questions?
BDGT393	Is something troubling you?
BDBL394	Jawbreaker.
BDGT395	Is it good?
BDBL396	Yep.
BDGT397	You don't say much, do you?
BDBL398	Nope.
BDBL399	Yep.
BDGT400	Well. That's just terrific, isn't it?
BDBL401	Yep.
BDBL402	Yep.
BDGT403	I said, `I sure could go for a jawbreaker right about now.`
BDBL404	I hope you find one.
BDBL405	Sure am.
BDGT406	Okay. Just checking.
BDBL407	Me too.
BDGT408	See? When you look at it that way, we're really not all that different, you and I.
BDBL409	Whatever.
BDBL410	No.
BGGT301	Excuse me, but...
BGBB302	What a lucky pirate are ye!
BGGT303	Me?
BGBB304	Ye've struck GOLD, boy!
BGGT305	I have?
BGBB306	GOLD! GOLD!! GOLD!!! Ha-Ha!
BGBB307	GOLDEN NUGGETS O' CHICKEN!
BGGT308	Oh.
BGBB309	A treasure trove o' deep-fried fun!
BGBB310	Now, what can kindly ol' Captain Blondebeard bring ye fer lunch?
BGSO311	I'll have the broasted wattle molé.
BGSO312	I'll try the wishbone sandwich with sweet gherkins.
BGSO313	Cheese toast! Got any?
BGSO314	Naw. Nothing for me, thanks.
BGBB315	I'm afraid we're out of that fine and economical dish.
BGBB316	It be just as well.
BGBB317	We're out o' that, I'm afraid!
BGBB318	Actually, I'm out of just about everything. Not a drumstick left.
BGBB319	All I have left are those biscuits and a few tubs of our special ipecac slaw.
BGGT320	How's the ipecac slaw?
BGBB321	Not bad...
BGBB322	...but fifteen minutes later ya be hungry again.
BGSO323	Would you like to join my crew and sail to Blood Island?
BGSO324	Do you have any specials?
BGSO325	Do you have any other specials?
BGSO326	What's the 'More' in 'Biscuits and More?'
BGSO327	To whom were you going to deliver your chicken?
BGSO328	How long have you been out of chickens?
BGSO329	What do you miss most about your chicken?
BGSO330	Business must be good if you're sold out of chicken.
BGSO331	Nice gold tooth you have there.
BGSO332	Did I mention how much I admire your gold tooth?
BGSO333	Don't you ever like to get outside the shop?
BGSO334	What happened to your membership card again?
BGSO335	I'll let you get back to work.
BGBB336	Aye, ya did.
BGBB337	It's one heck of a gold tooth...and Blondebeard serves up one heck of a lunchtime value!
BGBB338	Now stop admirin' it so much!
BGBB339	Aye!
BGBB340	To the pirates at Danjer Cove!
BGBB341	It be me secret ingredient!
BGBB342	It makes me biscuits come alive with flavor!
BGBB343	There lies a pirate ship in Danjer Cove.
BGBB344	And the first mate o' that ship fancies me chicken.
BGBB345	But I better be deliverin' their chicken soon.
BGBB346	Most likely, I won't even have time to cook it.
BGGT347	Why is that?
BGBB348	Ya see, I gots me this 'delivery in thirty-days or it's free' policy.
BGBB349	And I be runnin' a bit behind.
BGGT350	What are the pirates of Danjer Cove like?
BGBB351	These pirates of Danjer Cove...
BGBB352	They're a secretive lot, and I can't say I've seen too much of them.
BGBB353	They seem to be what one would expect from a bunch o' grog swiggin' pirates.
BGBB354	As filthy and hairy a buncha swabs as you'd ever hope ta meet.
BGBB355	But beware o' their captain!
BGBB356	From what I hear, he's got the disposition of a shark in need of a root canal.
BGBB357	If he be catchin' ya near his boat, ye'll be tortured for sure!
BGBB358	We're out o' potatoes, but we still have some eyes left!
BGBB359	Thar be a heapin' glob a lard I keep in the back fer special occasions.
BGBB360	Have ye tried peat moss and tree bark? Many parts be edible, ya know.
BGBB361	One word fer ya...
BGBB362	Hummus.
BGBB363	No more.
BGGT364	No thanks.
BGBB365	Weeks...months maybe.
BGBB366	And it's not the loss o' business that hurts me the most.
BGGT367	No?
BGBB368	I miss the taste o' me chicken!
BGBB369	Ye can dine this whole world over, but ye'll ne'er be a connoisseur o' carrion...
BGBB370	...'til ye've had a taste o' me savory squab!
BGBB371	Why even now, I gots me a cravin' fer me palate pleasin' poultry!
BGBB372	Ah, I can taste it now!
BGBB373	Me crispy Bounty o' Breaded Beaks!
BGBB374	Thar be nothin' like the hearty crunch from these pan-fried jewels!
BGGT375	Isn't that a little hard on your teeth?
BGBB376	Aye! But the challenge of it all be half the dining enjoyment!
BGBB377	Now that I got the thought o' that crispy chicken extremity in me head...
BGBB378	...I'll be pinin' fer the crunch 'til I get me somethin' ta crack me teeth on!
BGBB379	The feel of the rubbery chicken sinew against me gums!
BGBB380	Why, ye can chew on the same piece from here to Cape Horn and it'll never lose it's flavor!
BGBB381	That be VALUE!
BGBB382	If I had somethin' chewy like me chicken, then I'd be a happy Cap'n!
BGBB383	The crunch! It's the crunch I be missin' most!
BGBB384	I miss havin' somethin' ta chew.
BGBB385	Sold out? I never said nothin' bout bein' sold out.
BGGT386	Then what happened to all your chicken?
BGBB387	Aaah! 'Tis a story steeped in terror! Marinated in mayhem!
BGBB388	Aye!
BGBB389	It glistens like the golden topping o' grease on me luscious batter-fried chicken!
BGBB390	Aye! I love the outdoors, especially the beach.
BGBB391	Why, I'm in fact a member o' the Brimstone Beach Club and Smorgy.
BGBB392	Been a member there for years.
BGGT393	How did you become a member?
BGBB394	I threatened to run them all through.
BGBB395	Then I lost me membership card.
BGBB396	Last time I remember having it, it was in me breast pocket.
BGBB397	I believe I was in me kitchen preparin' some grub.
BGBB398	Then I had that awful sneezin' fit. Oh, that was bad.
BGBB399	No matter. I guess I'll just have 'em issue me a new one.
BGBB400	It seems I lost it while I was cookin'.
BGBB401	What!?
BGBB402	Leave me shop unguarded!?
BGBB403	Why, ya treacherous tripe!
BGBB404	You're lucky I don't take out me whisk and run you straight through!
BGGT405	Whoa! Calm down.
BGGT406	I was just asking.
BGBB407	Sorry. I'm as edgy as a beached whale in Nantucket.
BGBB408	Just look at what fear o' that demonic fowl has done ta me nerves!
BGGT409	What's wrong?
BGBB410	There be a horror that prowls the jungles of Plunder Island.
BGBB411	A seven foot tall monster, he be. And he has a hatred for mankind unequaled.
BGBB412	His preternatural rage burns hotter than the coals used to roast a million of his kin.
BGBB413	He is El Pollo Diablo!
BGBB414	The devil chicken!
BGBB415	THE DEVIL CHICKEN!
BGGT416	The devil chicken.
BGBB417	He hates me the most of all.
BGBB418	And his revenge against me must be tastier than me 'hearty giblets and cracklin's party mix.'
BGGT419	What's he done?
BGBB420	He's turned loose ALL me chickens!
BGBB421	Returned them to the wild, to roam the jungles free, as nature intended.
BGBB422	Even now, I have a huge order to fill and no chicken to fill it.
BGBB423	But I know he's not through! Ruinin' me business is just the first step!
BGBB424	Some day, he'll return...FOR ME!
BGBB425	But mark this! I'll be ready for him!
BGBB426	And a seven-foot chicken means me business will be thrivin' once more!
BGBB427	But I've taken care of him!
BGGT428	Really? How?
BGBB429	He returned ta finish me off with his wicked poultry ways!
BGBB430	But I be a master at subduin' even the testiest livestock.
BGBB431	By now he should be cozyin' up to a side order o' fluffy spuds and gravy.
BMGT301	Elaine looks like she's all right.
BMGT302	HANG...ON...HONEY! I'M...GOING...TO...GET...YOU...OUT...OF...THIS...MESS!

BIBL301	...qulb...
BIGT302	I'll need two more sailors for my crew.
BIGT303	I'll need one more sailor for my crew.
BIGT304	Well, I've got my whole crew.
BIVH305	I say, sir, you have some nerve challenging Edward Van Helgen to a duel!
BIGT306	Ah, you were asking for it.
BIVH307	Now there's a challenge!
BIVH308	To the field of honor!
BINN309	Edward Van Helgen
BIVH310	Haven't I shamed you enough?
BIGT311	You haven't even begun to see me shamed!
BIVH312	Back to the field of honor, then.
BIVH313	Welcome, patron, to The Barbery Coast...
BIBL314	...where every haircut is an adventure!
BIHM315	Aye! If yer wantin' a haircut, ye'll have to wait until I'm finished with Captain Rottingham here.
BIGT316	Are you guys pirate barbers?
BIVH317	We prefer the term `buccaneer hair stylists`.
BIGT318	Great! Maybe you guys can help me find this huge diamond ring I'm looking for!
BIHM319	Diamond ring?
BIGT320	Yeah! It's supposedly enormous, and it's on Blood Island!
BIRH321	Blood Island?
BIVH322	Never heard of it.
BIGT323	It's a funny story, really: I need it to lift this curse that's turned my girlfriend into a solid gold statue!
BIBL324	Solid gold?
BIGT325	Wait a second. Did I just share too much?
BIGT326	There's a plaque on this portrait.
BIGT327	It says...
BIGT328	'Captain Henry Gorgon'
BIGT329	'A terror on the seas...'
BIGT330	'...but the henna in his hair was a breeze!'
BIGT331	'Captain Richard Squawkins'
BIGT332	'There never was a more despicable knave!'
BIGT333	'But we gave him an impeccable body wave!'
BIGT334	'Captain Charles Vain'
BIGT335	'The captain stood seven feet high in his boots.'
BIGT336	'But you'd never have guessed that we dyed his roots.'
BIGT337	'Another satisfied customer.'
BIGT338	'Jack Rackaham'
BIGT339	'Always a dapper crook...'
BIGT340	'...Jack wore the layered look.'
BIGT341	'Captain Stede Grommette'
BIGT342	'He fought and he struggled...'
BIGT343	'...he kicked and he brawled...'
BIGT344	'...but when he left our shop...'
BIGT345	'...we made sure he was bald.'
BIGT346	'Thomas Lewd'
BIGT347	'Here was a dangerous man, when accosted.'
BIGT348	'But he looked pretty good when his hair had been frosted.'
BIGT349	'Rachel Squall'
BIGT350	'This lady, we're certain was no debutante.'
BIGT351	'She killed twenty men while she wore this bouffant.'
BIGT352	'Edward Screech'
BIGT353	'When it came to rum, Edward Screech never skimped.'
BIGT354	'He drank a whole bottle while he had his hair crimped.'
BIGT355	'In Loving Memory'
BIGT356	'Crackers'
BIGT357	'1684-1685'
BIGT358	Check this out.
BIBL359	Is that real gold?
BIBL360	I guess you can find treasure.
BIGT361	So you'll join my crew?
BIBL362	Sure, as long as my partners will join, too.
BIBL363	How did you do that?
BIGT364	Oh, it was nothing, really. Just sudden pressure applied below the sternum to expel a foreign object from the windpipe.
BIBL365	That's amazing! I owe you my life! From now on...
BIGT366	Yes?
BIBL367	From now on, that will be known as the Threepwood Maneuver.
BIBL368	Nah.
BIGT369	You know, I really appreciate your taking the time to talk to me.
BIGT370	I think we've, well, we've bonded.
BIGT371	Hey, pal! How's it going?
BIBL372	Gnk...
BIBL373	...trj...
BIBL374	...grfklbt...

BIBL381	...cough...
BIBL382	...drrrk...
BIBL383	...retch...
BIBL384	...gnlch...
BIHM385	Ach! Blast that ineffectual paperweight!
BIHM386	I'll have to go find another.
BIGT387	But what about my haircut?
BIHM388	Keep your skirt on, lad.
BIHM389	Holy infestation! You've been struck with the hair demons!
BIRH390	What are you talking about?
BIHM391	The cursed head vermin, the scourge of every hygienic sailor on the Seven Seas!
BIRH392	That's a lie!
BIHM393	Sure as I'm standin' here, they're wrigglin' about your scalp like a pack of wretched sea lions!
BIGT394	Good analogy.
BIHM395	This calls for drastic action. I'm bringing in Old Ironsides!
BIRH396	No, no, let's not be too rash.
BIGT397	Rash? That's a bad sign.
BIHM398	Thar's no time to lose! I'm going to have to ampytate!
BIRH399	No! No! You'll ruin my hair!
BIHM400	Arrrgh! Don't you be touchin' that thar handle, ye hairlubber!
BIGT401	I need to be sitting in the chair.
BIHM402	Arrgh! Keep yer hands off that chair handle!
BIGT403	I sure could use a haircut.
BIHM404	Have a seat, laddie, and I'll do you up with a fine coif!
BIGT405	I'd like to finish that haircut.
BIHM406	Then have a seat!
BIHM407	Whew! Well, I searched the whole island and I couldn't find a single rock for a paperweight.
BIHM408	I suppose I'll just have to eyeball your haircut!
BIGT409	I just remembered. I have another appointment.
BIHM410	Aww... I was going to give you a French braid, too!
BIGT411	I can't see from here in the chair.
BIGT412	I'm afraid he might cut my ear off if I get up.
BIGT413	Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pi...
BIRH414	Quiet!
BIGT415	...rate. Huh?
BIRH416	Don't distract him while he's working on me!
BIHM417	Aye, laddie. Ye'll have to wait yer turn.
BIHM418	It's the pirate way.
BIGT419	Excuse me, but...
BIRH420	Wait your turn!
BIGT421	That comb looks like it's made from a jawbone...
BIGT422	...and this gum is the kind that won't stick to dental work.
BIBL423	Hands off those combs!
BIBL424	ERRUCKK!
BIVH425	Those are ours!
BIGT426	I guess he doesn't want me to touch those.
BIBL427	What do you want me to do with that?
BIBL428	I told you to come back when you found gold.
BIGT429	It's golden brown! Probably delicious!
BIBL430	Keep trying.
BINZ431	comb
BIGT432	It's a comb, probably made from the jawbone of some near-extinct sea mammal.
BIGT433	It's crawling with lice.
BIHM434	Arrrgh! Hands off that comb or I'll have yer bangs, ye thieving dog!
BIGT435	He was too fast for me.
BIGT436	It probably tastes like that blue stuff.
BIGT437	Ewww!
BINZ438	barber chair
BIGT439	It's an adjustable barber's chair.
BIRH440	Wait your turn!
BIGT441	I've got what I need from that chair already.
BIGT442	I'm already sitting here!
BINZ443	barber chair
BINZ444	barber chair
BINZ445	barber chair
BINZ446	barber chair
BINZ447	handle
BIGT448	It's the handle the barber uses to raise and lower the chair.
BIHM449	Arrrgh! Don't you be puttin' your scurvy lips on that thar handle!
BINZ450	handle
BINZ451	handle
BINZ452	handle
BINZ453	handle
BINZ454	scissors
BIGT455	Wow! I bet those could cut through anything!
BIGT456	That's a surefire way to get a nasty tongue injury.
BIGT457	I can't reach them.
BIGT458	I don't want to cut that.
BIGT459	Those scissors are not a toy!
BINZ460	scissors
BINZ461	hairstyling book
BIGT462	`Coiffures for the Discerning Pirate: Spring Edition`
BIGT463	I'll wait for the movie.
BINZ464	paperweight
BIGT465	It's a rock, and it's a paperweight!
BIRH466	Don't touch that, you foul creature!
BIRH467	Or this ape may ruin my haircut.
BIRH468	Keep your grubby mitts off that paperweight!
BIHM469	Keep yer hands off me paperweight.
BIGT470	I can't reach it.
BIGT471	I'm too low.
BIGT472	That doesn't need holding down.
BIGT473	This paperweight feels heavy.
BINZ474	barber pirate
BIGT475	He looks like a true professional.
BIGT476	I think he'd notice.
BIHM477	Thank ye, but I just brushed my teeth.
BISQ478	Want to see what's under my kilt?
BIHM479	Arr, where's that coming from?
BIHM480	Arr, I'm not in need of a purge right now, laddy.
BINZ481	Captain Rottingham
BIGT482	He seems irritable.
BIGT483	I'd like to punch him one, but that'd be rude.
BIRH484	Get that away from me. It's disgusting!
BISQ485	I'd like a crewcut, please.
BISQ486	Make my head shine like a cue ball.
BISQ487	Shave me like a yak.
BISQ488	Give me that Mexican Hairless look, please.
BISQ489	Make me balder than Largo LaGrande.
BIHM490	Aye Aye, Captain Rottingham!
BIHM491	Whatever you say, sir!
BIHM492	Your wish is my command!
BIRH493	No, Stop!
BIGT494	Tee Hee!
BINZ495	salty pirate
BIGT496	It's a salty pirate, sucking on some candy.
BIGT497	It's a choking pirate.
BIGT498	It's a salty pirate.
BIGT499	Hi.
BIBL500	Hrmvlnt!
BIGT501	I don't want to smack him around.
BIGT502	I've impressed him enough.
BIBL503	That thing almost killed me! I don't want it back!
BIBL504	I don't want that. I'm a vegetarian.
BIBL505	No, a rainbow yawn is not my idea of a good time.
BINZ506	chewed gum
BIGT507	It's some pre-chewed, meat-flavored gum.
BIGT508	That doesn't need chewed gum.
BIGT509	This gum feels squishy.
BINZ510	jawbreaker
BIGT511	It's only got a little bit of spit and hair on it.
BIGT512	Eww! Gross! It's got someone else's spit and hair all over it.
BIGT513	That doesn't need a jawbreaker.
BIGT514	This jawbreaker feels really hard.
BIGT515	Hard candy and gum don't mix.
BINZ516	dapper pirate
BIGT517	It's a dapper pirate.
BIVH518	Slap me again and you'll be drinkin' tea with Davy Jones!
BIVH519	No, thank you. It would ruin my dinner.
BIVH520	No, thank you. I'm sick to death of that gum.
BIVH521	I'm not in the mood to drive the porcelain bus.
BIGT522	Uhhh...porcelain.
BINZ523	jar o' combs
BIGT524	It's a bunch of combs floating in that blue stuff.
BIGT525	I'm tempted, but I'd better not.
BIGT526	They would drown in there.
BINZ527	portrait
BIGT528	I don't need a picture of someone THAT ugly.
BINZ529	portrait
BIGT530	It's too high to reach and too ugly to want.
BINZ531	portrait
BIGT532	I don't want it.
BIGT533	That painting is unutterably hideous.
BINZ534	skull painting
BIGT535	I would rather die than own that painting.
BINZ536	portrait
BIGT537	I'm afraid that if I touched that painting...
BIGT538	...I would be infected by the ugliness of it.
BINZ539	portrait
BIGT540	I don't want that horrible painting.
BINZ541	portrait
BIGT542	I don't want that!
BIGT543	That's the ugliest painting in the shop!
BINZ544	portrait
BIGT545	No.
BIGT546	That painting leaves me cold.
BINZ547	portrait
BIGT548	Why would I want something that ugly?
BINZ549	parrot painting
BIGT550	I should leave that.
BIGT551	That's the only art in here that's any good.
B2GT301	Ahem.
B2GB302	Oh, hello there.
B2GT303	Uh. hi.
B2GB304	Hello again, handsome.
B2SO305	Who are you and what are you doing here?
B2SO306	Were there any other suitors you found attractive?
B2SO307	What happened to that young man you liked so much?
B2SO308	Go into the light!
B2SO309	Hey, nice ring!
B2SO310	Where's the diamond for your ring?
B2SO311	Where did LeChuck take the diamond?
B2SO312	Since you're...uh...not using it, can I have your engagement band?
B2SO313	How do I get out of this crypt?
B2SO314	When will you be able to go to your rest?
B2SO315	This is just a shade too creepy for me. I'm leaving!
B2SO316	I'll just check back in with you later.
B2GB317	He sold it to the smugglers of Skull Island!
B2GB318	Why, the last time I saw Charles he had checked into the hotel.
B2GB319	This ring will remain on my finger until I have a wedding band to replace it.
B2GB320	You mean besides LeChuck?
B2GB321	Well, there was ONE I could have fallen for.
B2GB322	Young Charles DeGoulash. He had such a radiant smile!
B2GT323	What happened to him?
B2GB324	You know it's funny, I don't know.
B2GB325	He checked into the hotel one night and I never saw him again.
B2GB326	The CAD!
B2GB327	The FIEND!
B2GB328	He sold it to the smugglers of Skull Island!
B2GB329	It's just SO humiliating! I could just die!
B2GB330	It's gone! He took it!
B2GT331	Who took it?
B2GB332	My love! My honeycakes! My widdle schnoobums! My LeChuck!
B2GT333	LeChuck is your schnoobums!?
B2GB334	He pried the diamond from its setting during the rehearsal dinner.
B2GB335	<sob> Oh, what a fool I was!
B2GB336	He told me he was taking it out to get some fresh air!
B2GB337	If only it were that easy!
B2GB338	I'm afraid I can never leave this crypt until I marry.
B2GB339	Are you attached?
B2SO340	Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes.
B2SO341	Boy-howdy, YES!
B2SO342	Engaged, actually!
B2SO343	No.
B2GT344	You bet!
B2GB345	What a shame. You sure have pretty eyes.
B2GT346	<Gulp.>
B2NN347	Minnie
B2GB348	I am Minnie Goodsoup, last in a long line of eligible Goodsoup debutantes.
B2GB349	I was buried here exactly one week after my wedding day.
B2GB350	A wedding day that never came.
B2GT351	What happened?
B2GB352	I was the belle of Blood Island.
B2GT353	How many people can claim THAT?
B2GB354	Oh, how the lads adored me. I was courted by the richest, most handsome men in the Caribbean.
B2GB355	But all my suitors bored me to tears.
B2GB356	I wanted someone dangerous. I wanted...a pirate!
B2GB357	By the way, what do you do for a living?
B2GT358	Flooring inspector.
B2GB359	Oh.
B2GB360	Then one day, a real pirate sailed his ship into the bay.
B2GB361	I fell for him instantly and we became engaged.
B2GB362	But he left me standing at the altar, and I died of a broken heart.
B2GT363	Wow.
B2GT364	That bites.
B2GB365	I know.
B2GB366	<sob>
B2GT367	Was it something I said?
B2GB368	I hate this ring!
B2GB369	It's been passed down from mother to daughter in the Goodsoup family for generations.
B2GB370	It was to be my wedding ring, until that evil pirate stole the diamond and left me.
B2GB371	Left me here to die of a broken heart!
B2GB372	There's no way out of this crypt for either of us.
B2GB373	I must haunt this lonely tomb until I've married a man I truly love.
B2GB374	And you can't leave because the door's locked.
BRGT301	The pitcher's empty.
BRGT302	Here's a drink for you!
BRPL303	Mmmm...
BRPL304	Tangy!
BRPL305	But not very refreshing.
BRPL306	Have you got anything else, babe?
BRGT307	No, BABE!
BRPL308	Then bring me another of those.
BRPL309	That was good. Now bring me another.
BRGT310	I've brought you a new mug.
BRPL311	Thanks.
BRGT312	Here's your drink, sir.
BRGT313	Look, Palido! You're burning!
BRPL314	Aaaah! All those months in the sun and my tan is just going to peel away!
BRPL315	I'd better turn over.
BRGT316	Good idea.
BRGT317	I really wish I didn't have to do that.
BRNZ318	sunbather
BRGT319	He's asleep.
BRGT320	He's incredibly pale.
BRGT321	He's still incredibly pale.
BRGT322	He's all crispy and peeled now.
BRGT323	He's already got a nice, new, bottomless mug.
BRGT324	He's asleep.
BRGT325	Here's your mug.
BRGT326	He's asleep.
BRGT327	He's asleep.
BRGT328	Here's your drink.
BRPL329	Well, get me a mug babe.
BRGT330	The dye would blot out the map.
BRGT331	He's asleep.
BRGT332	I think he's fallen asleep.
BRGT333	He's asleep.
BRPL334	Babe, babe! What are you trying to do?
BRPL335	Fry me up like a pork chop?
BRGT336	I doubt he'd want any gum.
BRSQ337	I am the...
BRPL338	Oh, a ventriloquism act, eh?
BRPL339	Give it up, babe.
BRPL340	That voice-throwing stuff was passé before Drake beat the Armada.
BRNZ341	bottomless mug
BRGT342	It's a bottomless mug.
BRGT343	It's empty. See, because there's no bottom.
BRGT344	He's asleep.
BRGT345	I don't want that useless mug back!
BRNZ346	mug
BRGT347	It's one ugly mug.
BRGT348	It's Palido's ugly mug.
BRGT349	It's also empty.
BRGT350	It's also full.
BRGT351	I don't want to use the mug with that.
BRGT352	This feels like a solid mug.
BRGT353	Ewww! That tastes awful!
BRGT354	There's nothing in it to drink.
BRGT355	It's full now.
BRNZ356	map
BRGT357	Because of his sunburn, the map on Palido's back is peeling off.
BRGT358	I'll never memorize that map.
BRGT359	It's far too complex.
BRGT360	It's the map to Blood Island, peeled off Palido's back.
BRGT361	I can't just rip the map off his back!
BRGT362	I don't want to use the map with that.
BRGT363	It's crackly, crispy, skin.
BRGT364	That's barbaric!
BRGT365	I don't want to ruin the map!
BRGT366	I'd rather go around the long way than go across that hot sand.
B3GT301	Excuse me...
B3KN302	I'm all sold out.
B3KN303	Now I have enough money for law school.
B3SO304	I'm a Fearsome Pirate.
B3SO305	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I really AM a Fearsome Pirate.
B3SO306	I guess you've learned an important lesson about cheating.
B3SO307	When you cheat others, you're really cheating yourself.
B3SO308	Winners never cheat, and cheaters never win.
B3SO309	Cheating can make you rich, but it won't make you happy.
B3SO310	What do you have for sale today?
B3SO311	I'd like to buy some cannons for my pirate ship.
B3SO312	Never mind.
B3KN313	I sure have, Mister.
B3KN314	Boy do I know that now!
B3KN315	Boy, is that true.
B3KN316	You sure taught me a lesson.
B3KN317	Golly. I'll never cheat on anyone ever again! Honest!
B3KN318	I've got a new business now and gosh it's swell!
B3GT319	What is it?
B3KN320	I'm running guns!
B3GT321	Tell me you're lying.
B3KN322	I never lie any more Mr. You've shown me the light.
B3KN323	Can I interest you in some shrapnelizing ammunition designed to bring exquisite pain and unreasonable suffering to all your enemies?
B3KN324	You're so Fearsome that even I can't help you.
B3KN325	You got the absolute top-of-the-line set of Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannon,
B3KN326	and I ain't got anything better to sell you.
B3KN327	Well, you may be a pirate...
B3KN328	...(even if you look more like a broom handle)...
B3KN329	...but you aren't a Fearsome Pirate unless...
B3KN330	...your ship is equipped with the latest in offensive weaponry...
B3KN331	...from Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannon, Inc.
B3GT332	Gee...
B3GT333	...I guess you're right.
B3GT334	But how can I ever hope to afford any first-class cannons...
B3GT335	...like the ones manufactured by the master craftsmen at Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannon, Inc.?
B3KN336	Well, DUH!
B3KN337	You DID say you were a pirate, didn't you Mister?
B3GT338	Well, yes...
B3KN339	Go out on the high seas and plunder yourself some treasure!
B3KN340	Once your treasure hold is chock-full-o-booty...
B3KN341	...come back and we'll talk turkey.
B3GT342	O.K.
B3KN343	Yeah, well, you may be a pirate...
B3KN344	...but you aren't a Fearsome Pirate unless...
B3KN345	...your ship is equipped with the latest in offensive weaponry...
B3KN346	...from Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannon, Inc.
B3KN347	However...
B3KN348	I see that you are a pirate ready to take that first step...
B3KN349	...toward becoming the ultimate Fearsome Pirate.
B3KN350	You sir look ready to buy your first set of top-quality Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannons.
B3KN351	Well, you sure are a Fearsome pirate...
B3KN352	...but think how much more Fearsome you could be...
B3KN353	...if you upgraded your set of Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannon...
B3KN354	...to an even more powerful model.
B3KN355	Today, (customer name here)...
B3KN356	...er... what was your name again?
B3GT357	Guybrush Threepwood.
B3KN358	Today, Mr. Cheap-Hood... 
B3KN359	Today, Mr. Leap-Good... 
B3KN360	Today, Mr. Freep-Snood... 
B3KN361	...I can offer you the complete line from Bob's Big Bore Boomer Brand Cannon, Inc.
B3KN362	To start with, we have the entry level model, the `Buccaneer's Buddy.`
B3KN363	We also have the following cannon models available:
B3KN364	...the `Ouch-Master`...
B3KN365	...the `Holemaker Deluxe`...
B3KN366	...the `Paingiver 2000`...
B3KN367	...`Mr. Massacre`...
B3KN368	...and finally, the cannon used by that most fearsome scoundrel René Rottingham himself...
B3KN369	...the Destructomatic T-47!
B3KN370	So, can I interest you in any of these models, Mister?
B3SO371	I'll take the `Buccaneer's Buddy!`
B3SO372	I'll take the `Ouch-Master!`
B3SO373	I'll take the `Holemaker Deluxe!`
B3SO374	I'll take the `Paingiver 2000!`
B3SO375	I'll take the `Mr. Massacre!' brand cannon.
B3SO376	I'll take the `Destructomatic T-47!`
B3KN377	Hey, what kinda cheap jerk are you?
B3KN378	You already got cannons better than that!
B3KN379	Why don't you buy something more expensive?
B3KN380	The `Buccaneer's Buddy` it is!
B3KN381	Let me just check my stock...
B3KN382	Yep, we got 'em!
B3KN383	You will not be disappointed, my friend!
B3KN384	The `Ouch-Master` it is!
B3KN385	One `Holemaker Deluxe` coming right up!
B3KN386	The `Paingiver 2000` it is!
B3KN387	One `Mr. Massacre` comin' right up.
B3KN388	Whoa mister, you've entered a select group o' pirates.
B3KN389	You've just ordered the `Destructomatic T-47 armor-piercing Carnage Delivery System with auto-loading and fax-modem!
B3KN390	Quite a fine piece of hardware if I do say so myself.
B3KN391	Now, will that be doubloons, jewels, captured maidens?
B3KN392	How would you like to pay for those?
B3SO393	My ship's hold is full of booty!
B3SO394	I've got these wooden nickels...
B3SO395	Could I interest you in an authentic gold tooth?
B3SO396	I changed my mind, I don't want any cannons.
B3KN397	No thanks, I have all my teeth.
B3KN398	Listen, I'm not doing this for my health, you know.
B3KN399	Just because you're a grownup...
B3KN400	...doesn't mean that you can waste my time.
B3KN401	Come back when you have some green, toothpick.
B3KN402	Well, the amount in your treasure hold is not enough for this model...
B3GT403	Would you take my old cannons as a trade in?
B3KN404	Well, I don't know...
B3KN405	...they are pretty banged up...
B3KN406	Hang on while I check the blue book on 'em...
B3PN407	Here, Kenny whips out a Blue Book and thumbs through it.
B3KN408	Okay.
B3KN409	I'll have my mom install your new cannon pronto!
B3KN410	While she's at it I'll also have her pick up the appropriate amount from your hold...
B3KN411	...and pick up your trade in.
B3KN412	MOM!!!
B3KN413	Well, the amount in your treasure hold is not enough for this model...
B3KN414	...not even if I take yer old cannon and give ya credit for the trade in.
B3KN415	Can I interest you in a less expensive model?
B3KN416	So get out of here, okay Mister?

CCCB301	Yes. May I help you?
CCSO302	My name is Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pirate.
CCSO303	I've just been in a rousing pirate battle. Mind if I towel off?
CCSO304	Something sure smells...uh...cooked. Got anything to eat?
CCSO305	I'm going to go wander down the beach for a while.
CCCB306	Threepwood? You must be `Seersucker` Skip Rackham's cousin.
CCCB307	How are Muffy and the twins?
CCGT308	Who?
CCCB309	Sure, but...
CCCB310	Hey, it's a lovely afternoon for the beach today. Not too crowded yet.
CCCB311	There's a crafts workshop on the south beach and a `Swabercize` class at two and four.
CCCB312	Water's warm and the waves aren't too high.
CCCB313	Just watch out for the occasional undead corpse washing up on shore.
CCCB314	Might want to keep the kids away from any rotting flesh.
CCCB315	But otherwise, the siege earlier today shouldn't spoil your afternoon.
CCCB316	Just between you and me...the undead are notoriously bad tippers. So it's just as well they didn't take over the island, eh? Ha, ha.
CCCB317	Let me see your membership card and we'll fix you right up.
CCSO318	Membership card? But I'm wearing my membership T-shirt.
CCSO319	I'm delivering these fine leather monogrammed golf jackets.
CCSO320	You don't need to see my identification.
CCSO321	Stand aside I'm in a killin' mood.
CCCB322	I don't need to see your identification.
CCGT323	I'm not the pirate you're looking for.
CCCB324	You're not the pirate I'm looking for.
CCGT325	I can go about my business.
CCCB326	You can go about your business.
CCGT327	Move along.
CCCB328	Move along...move...Hey! Wait a minute!
CCCB329	Your mind games won't work on me, boy.
CCCB330	No membership card I see.
CCCB331	Well, SIR...
CCGT332	Why?
CCCB333	You're at the Brimstone Beach Country Club and Smorgy.
CCCB334	Part of the Leisure Lubber's Planned Community for Retired Pirates. It's VERY exclusive.
CCCB335	I'm afraid if you don't have a membership card you cannot use any of the club's amenities.
CCGT336	I don't want an amenity.
CCGT337	I had to eat one of those while I was lost at sea and it was terrible.
CCCB338	Then let me also point out that without that membership card you are not permitted on the beach...
CCCB339	...you can not use any of our towels...
CCCB340	...and you can't have anything from the grill.
CCCB341	Good day!
CCGT342	Hi.
CCCB343	Yes?
CCSO344	Hand me a towel, young man.
CCSO345	How about a towel? I know the secret handshake.
CCSO346	It's me! Biff! From the polo team?
CCSO347	Please. Can I have a towel.
CCSO348	Let me have some of that cooking oil.
CCSO349	Onion ring emergency! Give me all the oil you've got.
CCSO350	Please pass the cooking oil!
CCSO351	I was thinking of joining a club for snotty rich folks...
CCSO352	What if I just washed up a bit? Then could I join your club?
CCSO353	Please. Can I join your club?
CCSO354	Gotta be going.
CCCB355	Those towels are for club members only.
CCCB356	Ever since Thurston `The Hook` Eddington joined last year, the whole secret handshake thing just kinda got messy.
CCCB357	We don't have one anymore.
CCCB358	But, of course all MEMBERS know that.
CCGT359	My pony is about to give birth!
CCGT360	Quick! Boil some water and get me lots and lots of towels!
CCCB361	Not buying it, Mr. Mangy Pirate.
CCCB362	The only way you can have a towel is if you're a member of the club.
CCCB363	That oil is only for french frying. It stays right here.
CCGT364	Hey! What a coincidence! I'm French! Toss that baby right over here.
CCCB365	You don't SOUND French. And you don't LOOK French. And you don't KNOW how much you're getting on my nerves.
CCCB366	Sorry. As long as I'm in charge here, you'll get no handouts.
CCCB367	No can do.
CCCB368	I'm not authorized to hand out cooking supplies to anyone.
CCGT369	Where do I sign?
CCCB370	Well, it's not that easy...
CCCB371	First you'll have to get on our waiting list. That could take several months.
CCCB372	Then there's the credit check, references, family history...
CCCB373	...the oral presentation and the written test...
CCCB374	...mostly dealing with Spanish treasure, pillaging and golfing in the greater Caribbean area...
CCCB375	...and then finally our fourteen step interviewing process.
CCGT376	And then I'll be in your club?
CCCB377	No, I'm afraid after that I'd have to black-ball you.
CCCB378	It's nothing personal, but club policy states that I have to exclude...
CCCB379	`Anyone whose odor or presence might disgust or offend the other members.`
CCCB380	I'm sure you understand.
CCCB381	There is no way this club would accept you.
CCCB382	Sorry.
CCGT383	Please!
CCGT384	You gotta help me!
CCCB385	Are you a member of this club?
CCGT386	But my fiancée has been...
CCCB387	Is she a member of this club?
CCGT388	Well, no. But she's been cursed by an evil...
CCCB389	If she's not a member of the club, I can't help you.
CCCB390	If you have curse problems, I suggest you find the Voodoo Lady.
CCGT391	The Voodoo Lady!
CCGT392	Got it!
CCGT393	One more time.
CCGT394	Where can I look for help with my curse problems?
CCCB395	Find the home of the Voodoo Lady.
CCCB396	Only she can help you.
CCGT397	Thanks!
CCGT398	Oh, cabaña boy?
CCCB399	Yesss...
CCGT400	It's quite hot. Fetch a towel and mop my brow, would you?
CCCB401	Can I have another look at that card of yours?
CCGT402	Uh...actually the towels are right here. I'll just help myself.
CCGT403	Tell me more about my membership benefits.
CCCB404	The Brimstone Beach Country Club and Smorgy is the exclusive resort hideaway...
CCCB405	...for only the most discerning pirates and their families.
CCCB406	Here you'll be pampered by a courteous staff...ugh...
CCCB407	...always eager to meet your every need.
CCCB408	Whether it be recommending a keel-hauling class, finding a fourth for bridge, or giving a golf lesson on our award winning course...
CCCB409	...designed by `Peg Leg` Malloy.
CCCB410	Free valet ship parking included.
CCGT411	Will you bury me in the sand?
CCCB412	I'll start digging your grave right now.
CCCB413	May I help you?
CCGT414	Nothing. I just wanted to be sure that you're there for me.
CCCB415	Ooooooh!
CVPN001	Unlimited cannon balls mode ON.
CVPN002	Unlimited cannon balls mode STILL ON.
CVGT003	Hey! I'm getting pretty good at this...
CVGT004	Ewww, gross... all the bones and stuff are floating towards the ship.
CVGT005	Whoops!
CVGT006	That was me. Uh, sorry.
CVGT007	Uh, sorry about that!
CVGT008	Oops! My fault!
CVGT009	Oooh. Ouch.
CNGT001	I've got to get out of here and help Elaine!
CNGT002	If I could only get through this one door...
CNGT003	...then I could easily overpower the armed guards above...
CNGT004	...slip over the side and make for the shore.
CNWY005	Quit yer mumbling, captive!
CNGT006	Hey! I lost my cutlass when the ship capsized.
CNWY020	Get your hands off that cannon!
CNWY021	Don't you touch that cannon!
CNWY022	That's LeChuck's property! Hands off!
CNWY023	Don't touch that!
CNWY024	Stand yer distance!
CNWY025	Stay away!
CNWY026	Stand back!
CNWY027	Any closer and it's curtains for you!
CNWY028	You're in my personal space, ya lubber!
CNWY029	If you give me room to be me own pirate...
CNWY030	...then I can give you room to be your own pirate.
CNGT031	I'm glad we had this talk.
CNWY032	Ya wretched refuse!
CNWY033	Ya better fear!
CNWY034	Blast ye scurvy dogs!
CNWY035	This will make you rue the day!
CNWY036	Avast, ye swabs! Prepare fer yer doom!
CNWY037	Ya drink bilge water, and yer mothers dress you funny!
CNWY038	Take that!
CNWY039	Let's see if you can take this!
CNWY040	I'll reduce yer fort ta rubble!
CNWY041	I feel like I could, TAKE ON THE WORLD!
CNWY042	You in the fort! Yer doom be at hand!
CNWY043	Somehow, I find all this violence desensitizing.
CNGT044	Hello!
CNGT045	Is there anybody in there who's not evil or dead?
CNGT046	Hmmm...
CNGT047	There's no point calling out.
CNGT048	If there was anyone in there...
CNGT049	...they would be some sort of minion of darkness.
CNGT050	If there are any of you stinking, wretched fiends of the damned in there...
CNGT051	...could you open this door?
CNGT052	It's not that I'm trying to escape or anything.
CNGT053	It's just that I'd like to step outside and enjoy an adult beverage.
CNGT054	Hey!
CNGT055	If there are any of you rancid, evil, deviant hellspawn behind this door...
CNGT056	You'd better watch out!
CNGT057	'Cause I'm breaking out of here!
CNGT058	No one can hear me through this door.
CNGT059	If only I could get it open!
CNGT060	I see a diorama of the children of the world living in peace and freedom.
CNGT061	No, wait.
CNGT062	It can't be that.
CNGT063	It's just too dark to make out what's in there.
CNGT064	It's too dark to see.
CNNZ065	locked door
CNGT066	It looks pretty sturdy.
CNGT067	I couldn't force that door open with my bare hands.
CNGT068	The door is too strong for the cutlass to cut through.
CNNZ069	cannon
CNGT070	Hey! It's one of those new, self-loading cannons I've heard so much about.
CNGT071	It's already loaded and ready to fire.
CNNZ072	small pirate
CNGT073	I don't think I've ever seen a cuter pirate.
CNGT074	I don't want to disturb him.
CNGT075	He's had a hard day.
CNGT076	If I rough him up, he may shoot me.
CNGT077	I don't want to slap the little guy around.
CNGT078	I'm not going to bludgeon poor Wally with this.
CNGT079	Wally doesn't need this hook any more.
CNNZ080	ramrod
CNGT081	Looks like a ramrod for the cannon.
CNGT082	I don't want to talk to the ramrod.
CNGT083	That doesn't need to be loaded.
CNGT084	This has to be used with something else.
CNNZ085	plastic hook
CNGT086	It's Wally's fake pirate hook.
CNGT087	It's not a toothpick.
CNGT088	Scraping a hook on that would be pointless.
CNGT089	I don't need to wear a hook.
CNGT090	I have two good hands.
CNGT091	I don't want to pop the balloon.
CNNZ092	gaff
CNGT093	It's a ramrod with a plastic hook stuck on the end.
CNGT094	That doesn't look appetizing.
CNGT095	Hello, ramrod with plastic hook.
CNGT096	Scraping a hook on that would be pointless.
CNGT097	I can't just use this by itself.
CNNZ098	cannon restraint rope
CNGT099	It's the restraining rope for the cannon.
CNGT100	The rope has been cut.
CNGT101	There's nothing restraining the cannon now.
CNGT102	I could never untie that big a knot.
CNGT103	I can't pick it up.
CNGT104	One end is tied to the wall, the other end to the cannon.
CNGT105	I couldn't chew through that.
CNGT106	No.
CNGT107	It's cut now.
CNGT108	It's already cut.
CNGT109	Hooking the rope won't do anything.
CNNZ110	pirate literature
CNGT111	This is only for reading.
CNNZ112	keyhole
CNGT113	I don't have my lock-picking tools.
CNGT114	I never have been any good at lock-picking.
CNGT115	But I am still a mighty pirate, believe you me.
CNGT116	That's too big to fit in the keyhole.
CNNZ117	cannon balls
CNGT118	Nice cannon balls.
CNGT119	They're too heavy to carry.
CNGT120	The ramrod is for the cannon, not the cannon balls.
CNNZ121	grate
CNGT122	Grate.
CNGT123	There's nobody up there to hear me.
CNGT124	Well, nobody friendly, anyway.
CNGT125	I can't reach it.
CNGT126	I can't reach it.
CNGT127	The grate is solid wood. I can't push it open.
CNGT128	The hook is too big to fit through the grate.
CNNZ129	rope
CNGT130	It's an old, short, frayed rope.
CNGT131	It's tangled up in all that debris. I can't pick it up.
CNGT132	I've got enough fiber in my diet already.
CNGT133	Even if I could cut it loose, it's too short and frayed to be of any use.
CNNN134	useless rope
CNGT135	The rope is too short and frayed to be of any use.
CNNN136	useless rope
CNGT301	Ha-ha! Taste cold steel, feeble cannon restraint rope!
CNNZ302	Wally
CNGT303	I don't want to disembowel poor Wally.
CNNZ304	cannon
CLSW301	I'll take that old snowcone for you.
CLGT302	Thanks!
CLGT303	Yo, Murray.
CLGT304	 ...paste... 
CLGT305	 ...healthy bean curd... 
CLGT306	 ...synthetic hair from a dog that bit me... 
CLGT307	 ...fluffy, whipped egg whites... 
CLMR308	Run, mortal...
CLMR309	...but do not forget your arch-nemesis Murray!
CLMR310	Mark my words, I SHALL return to haunt you!
CLMR311	Do you hear me? I SHALL RETURN!
CLPN312	Guybrush changes back into a grownup
CLMR313	What!!!!!
CLMR314	You picked the anchor?
CLGT315	It's a really nice anchor, Murray. Sorry.
CLGT316	Yoo-hoo! Stinky Mr. Rat!
CLWR317	Hey! Get outta there ya little punk!
CLGT318	What ya gonna do about it, vermin-boy?
CLWR319	This'll teach you!
CLWR320	What are you doing over there?
CLGT321	I found this pie, Mister.
CLWR322	Huh? Oh, yeah. Thanks, kid.
CLGT323	Shoot it! Shoot it!
CLWR324	Not right now.
CLGT325	Oh, but I want to see the cannon fire!
CLWR326	Beat cheeks, half-pint.
CLGT327	Look, man. I pay your salary!
CLGT328	You want me to tell LeChuck you've got unhappy kids running around here?
CLWR329	Okay, okay, you little... 
CLWR331	Did you just hear something?
CLGT332	No.
CLWR333	Weird.
CLGT334	Maybe it's the acoustics of that smelly giant head.
CLWR335	Shut up, kid.
CLWR336	What are you doing over there?
CLGT337	I found this pie, Mister.
CLWR338	Thanks, kid, I -- 
CLWR339	Wait a second. Wait a second. This isn't a real pie.
CLWR340	It's not heavy enough.
CLWR341	Just what are you trying to pull here, pip-squeak?
CLGT342	Nothing, honest. Never mind.
CLWR343	Hey! What do you think you're doing?
CLGT344	I just want one of those pies... 
CLWR345	Yeah? Well, I just want out of this stinking rat head.
CLWR346	Life's tough, kid. Cope.
CLWR347	Get lost, kid.
CLWR348	Beat it.
CLWR349	Hands off.
CLWR350	Am-scray.
CLWR351	Stay away from those.
CLWR352	Hey!
CLWR353	You're too little to use that cannon, kid.
CLWR354	Wait for one of the older boys to come along. Huh?
CLGT355	But I really want to fire it!
CLWR356	It's too dangerous for a little boy to use.
CLGT357	I'm not a little boy! I'm twenty years old!
CLWR358	(Laugh) Right. And I'm Dinghy Dog. (Laugh)
CLGT359	You wish.
CLWR360	Half-pint little punk!
CLWR361	Get lost before I have to do something you're gonna regret.
CLWR362	I told you: hands off the cannon.
CLWR363	Keep away from that cannon, you little brat.
CLWR364	I'm not going to warn you again.
CLWR365	Get away from there!
CLWR366	Beat it, kid. You're getting on my nerves.
CLWR367	Hey! What are you doing over there?
CLGT368	I found this pie tin.
CLWR369	Oh, happy day! We're saved!
CLGT370	I was just offering... 
CLWR371	We don't need it, kid. Get lost.
CLDD372	(Hyuk!) Now that's not very nice, little boy.
CLDD373	Come on, now! Stop hitting your pal Dinghy Dog!
CLDD374	I'm not going to warn you again, kid.
CLDD375	(Hyuk!) You better cut that out.
CLDD376	You're really starting to bug me, kid.
CLDD377	All right, (hyuk!), that does it.
CLDD378	You're going down, little punk!
CLGT379	Ow! He bit me!
CLDD380	Give me back that hair, kid.
CLDD381	You're ruinin' the suit!
CLGT382	No way! He doesn't fight fair. He bites!
CLMR383	Hey! It's you!
CLMR384	Are you dead yet? You look different.
CLGT385	Not dead, Murray, just cursed.
CLMR386	Cursed? That's perfect!
CLMR387	I'm cursed, too. Let us join our cursed forces and together we can rule the world!
CLMR388	Bwahahahahahahaha!
CLGT389	Yeah. Let me get back to you on that.
CLMR390	Look into your heart! I'm the prize you really want!
CLMR391	Free me, my brother, and together we can reign terror across the land!
CLMR392	Come on, pick me!
CLMR393	You know I'm the best toy on the shelf!
CLMR394	None of the other toys can summon the forces of darkness!
CLMR395	Pick me Pick me Pick me!
CLMR396	What good is a Smuggle Bunny when you can have a demonic talking skull?
CLMR397	I'm such fun at parties!
CLMR398	Come on, we make such a good team!
CLMR399	Don't leave me here!
CLMR400	I can't believe you picked that stupid anchor instead of me.
CLMR401	What good is a dumb hunk of iron, anyway?
CLMR402	It's not even a REAL anchor...
CLMR403	...I'm a real talking skull!
CLMR404	After all we've been through together...
CLMR405	Fine! Take the stupid anchor!
CLMR406	You would have made a lousy undead monster anyway!
CLMR407	I'm going to wait for an owner who understands my need to bring fear and pestilence on the likes of you!
CLMR408	Get out of here before I call up the demonic legions of Hades and set them upon you like a swarm of angry locusts!
CLMR409	If you value your life, mere mortal, you will flee before Murray, Scourge of the Living and Uber-Skull of the Underworld!
CLMR410	Bwahahahahahahahahaha!
CLGT411	What kind of snow cones do you have?
CLSW412	(Cough) What kind of cones did you ask?...
CLSW413	Why I have every kind imaginable.
CLSW414	I have the most distinct types of snow cones in the world.
CLSW415	In fact my cones are so original, so inventive and so cough, cough, cough, sniff, unique...
CLSW416	...that most are completely inedible.
CLSW417	Let me list some for you...
CLSW418	I have sweet cones, meat cones, cold cones, mold cones, bold cones with lime...
CLSW419	...cones with slime...(Cough, cough)
CLSW420	...veggie cones, wedgy cones, hedgy cones, (I used some of my neighbor's hedge in that one)...
CLSW421	...cones with spice, cones with lice, berry cones, hairy cones, dairy cones...
CLSW422	...and at Christmas, ho ho ho, Merry cones.
CLSW423	So what do you think of that?!
CLGT424	I'll take one.
CLSW425	What would you like on it?
CLGT426	Mmmm... Peppery ice!
CLGT427	Tastes like ice!
CLGT428	Strawberry is great with fresh ground pepper.
CLGT429	Mmmm, I love strawberry!
CLGT430	A veritable peppery rainbow of flavor.
CLGT431	Rainbow snow cones are my favorite!
CLGT432	Yuck! The pepper helps, though.
CLGT433	What an incredible taste I've discovered!
CLGT434	It's a plain snow cone covered with pepper.
CLGT435	It's a plain snow cone.
CLGT436	It's a strawberry snow cone covered with savory, fresh ground pepper.
CLGT437	It's a strawberry snow cone.
CLGT438	It's a beautiful rainbow of flavor and color, topped with pepper.
CLGT439	It's a rainbow snow cone.
CLGT440	It's a disgusting snow cone, topped with... 
CLGT441	 ...and fresh ground pepper.
CLGT442	 ...and boy does it look good!
CLNZ443	pepper mill
CLGT444	It's a big pepper mill.
CLGT445	This does not need more seasoning.
CLGT446	I don't want to waste it.
CLNZ447	snowcone
CLGT448	Mmmm. Peppery goodness.
CLNN449	disgusting snowcone
CLGT450	Pasty.
CLNN451	disgusting snowcone
CLGT452	Bean Curdy.
CLNN453	disgusting snowcone
CLGT454	Eeeew. Hairy.
CLNN455	disgusting snowcone
CLGT456	That meringue looks tasty.
CLGT457	I'd rather keep my snow cone.
CLGT458	This snow cone is useless here.
CLNZ459	Dinghy Dog hair
CLGT460	It looks an awful lot like genuine dog hair.
CLGT461	Like oil and water.
CLGT462	The hair is useless here.
CLNZ463	anchor
CLGT464	This anchor looks good, heavy, and useful.
CLDD465	Hey, you can't just have that, kid!
CLGT466	I don't want to weigh that down.
CLGT467	This anchor would cause damage.
CLNZ468	soggy paper cone
CLGT469	It's all that's left of my snow cone.
CLGT470	Sucking on a soggy paper cone isn't half as satisfying as eating a snow cone.
CLGT471	Squishy.
CLNZ472	meringue pie
CLGT473	It's a bunch of bits of meringue from the pie.
CLGT474	I don't want to eat this on its own.
CLGT475	I'd rather keep these pie bits for a better time.
CLGT476	It feels delicious!
CLNZ477	Monty Meringue
CLGT478	I have to wonder if he's genuinely content with this line of work.
CLGT479	I can't throw it that far.
CLGT480	He's a mime. He doesn't talk.
CLNZ481	gate
CLGT482	Gate!
CLGT483	I can't go back there.
CLGT484	I'm deathly afraid of mimes.
CLNZ485	scale
CLGT486	Good old fashioned sturdy carnival scale.
CLDD487	(Hyuk!) That's not a toy, little boy.
CLGT488	It says it's very heavy.
CLNZ489	Dinghy Dog
CLGT490	Yikes!
CLGT491	He looks a lot less cute and a lot more huge and terrifying in person.
CLGT492	It's an endearing corporate symbol.
CLDD493	Nope! (Hyuk!) That ride's just for bigger kids!
CLNZ494	Wharf Rat
CLGT495	Cute. A grotesquely enormous, smelly rat.
CLGT496	I'd better not. I think he could take me.
CLWR497	Yeah, kid? What do you expect me to do with that?
CLGT498	Nothing. Never mind.
CLWR499	Yeah, that's a real nice toy, kid. (Laugh) Now beat it.
CLNZ500	stack of meringue pies
CLGT501	It's a huge stack of meringue pies!
CLNZ502	cannon
CLGT503	It's the cannon they use to launch pies at the clown.
CLWR504	Get your mouth away from that cannon, kid. It's dangerous.
CLNZ505	hole
CLGT506	I don't need any more abuse.
CLNZ507	soda jerk
CLGT508	I've already got a yummy snow cone to eat!

CLGT510	'You must be as tall as my hand to ride the roller coaster'

CLGT512	'Monkey Mountain Roller Coaster'
CLGT513	That's where LeChuck was taking Elaine!
CLGT514	I've got to get in there!
CLNZ515	Murray
CLGT516	Murray...
CLMR517	I'm not speaking to you.
CLMR518	How could you pick that anchor over your best friend?
CLGT519	It's Murray.
CLGT520	I like the guy, but this is getting ridiculous.
CLNZ521	Smuggle Bunny
CLGT522	Adorable.
CLDD523	That's not for free! <Hyuk!>
CLDD524	You've got to win it!
CYMR301	Hey... Hey Guybrush...
CYMR302	There sure are a lot of skeletons in here.
CYGT303	Uh-oh.
CYMR304	Quick, pull the head off one and stick me on top of the spine!
CYGT305	I don't think I want you walking around freely, Murray.
CYMR306	Oh, please!
CYGT307	I'm getting out of here.
CYGT308	Well Murray, are you ready to continue our heady adventuring?
CYGT309	Murray?
CYGT310	Where'd he go?
CYGT311	'Miller the Sot'
CYGT312	'Here lies old Miller.'
CYGT313	'He's far past his prime.'
CYGT314	'He drank some weed killer...'
CYGT315	'...with a half-twist of lime.'

CYGT334	I'd never be able to climb up there.
CYNZ335	plaque
CYGT336	'Free dirt.'
C2GT301	Well, I've got a crew, a map, a ship, and finally got Elaine back...
C2GT302	...So what say we head on to Blood Island!
C2GT303	How about it, guys?
C2GT304	Let's get moving towards Blood Island!
C2GT305	Let's head on out and find our fortune!
C2GT306	Guys?
C2GT307	This might be more difficult than I first imagined.
C3HM301	Arrgh! The sea.
C3BL302	Aye, the sea.
C3VH303	Makes you glad to be alive!
C3GT304	I think that ship is following us.
C3BL305	Feel that salty spray!
C3HM306	The sunlight sparkling off the bay!
C3VH307	What a glorious, sea-faring day!
C3GT308	It's a pirate ship!
C3GT309	We've got to outrun her!
C3GT310	All right, men!
C3GT311	Are you with me!
C3BL312	Hey!
C3BL313	Look guys!
C3BL314	A whale!
C3HM315	Where?
C3VH316	Where?
C3GT317	That ship is gaining on us.
C3GT318	Cutthroat Bill!
C3GT319	Rig the topsail!
C3VH320	Is that a Right whale?
C3HM321	No no, lad.
C3GT322	They're boarding us!
C3GT323	Crew!
C3GT324	Help me out here!
C3BL325	It is a member of the cetus suborder mysticeti, though.
C3VH326	I think you're right.
C3RH327	Well, well...
C3GT328	Rottingham! So it's you!
C3GT329	What do you want, other than a good toupee?
C3RH330	I've come for your map to the fabled Blood Island.
C3RH331	Then I'll find the diamond you mentioned.
C3RH332	It will make a fine paperweight for my escritoire.
C3VH333	Ooooh! Look!
C3VH334	It's breaching!
C3BL335	Oooooh!
C3HM336	Ah!
C3GT337	Look baldy, I'll never give you that map!
C3GT338	I need it to save Elaine!
C3RH339	Then I'll have to take it from you by force!
C3VH340	That whale must be thirty point five meters (one hundred feet)...
C3VH341	...and weigh two-hundred metric tons.
C3RH342	You know, of course...
C3RH343	...in a swordfight, a sharp wit is much more important than a sharp blade.
C3GT344	Of course!
C3GT345	Everybody knows that, chrome dome!
C3GT346	Let's get this over with.
C3RH347	Every enemy I've met, I've annihilated!
C3GT348	Oh, yeah!
C3GT349	Well...
C3GT350	You fight like a cow!
C3RH351	No, no, no, no.
C3RH352	That's not right at all.
C3GT353	What?
C3RH354	On the sea we fight it a little differently.
C3RH355	On the sea, all your insults and threats have to...
C3RH356	...RHYME.
C3GT357	What!?
C3RH358	So when I say, 'Every enemy I've met, I've annihilated!'...
C3RH359	...you say...
C3GT360	I once found some gold but it was just electroplated.
C3RH361	No! You say, 'With your breath, I'm sure they all suffocated.'
C3RH362	Let's try that again, shall we?
C3RH363	You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.
C3GT364	Uhhh.
C3RH365	I'm waiting!
C3GT366	I...I...
C3RH367	Just as I thought.
C3RH368	You're an amateur with a sword.
C3RH369	Give me that map!
C3GT370	Uh...here! Take it!
C3RH371	That's your map? Eeeeew!
C3RH372	As soon as I'm through pirating these waters, it's off to Blood Island!
C3RH373	Until we meet again, M. Tweephood.
C3GT374	I've got to get that map back or we'll never find Blood Island.
C4GT301	Whew!
C4GT302	I guess I blacked out for a second.
C4GT303	Where's Elaine?
C4HM304	She flew a wee bit into the woods when we crashed.
C4GT305	Then let's get going!
C4GT306	We'll find her then scour the island for the uncursed diamond ring that will transform her back to normal.
C4HM307	I don't be thinkin' we will, lad.
C4GT308	What do ye mean...I mean...What do you mean, Haggis?
C4HM309	This be a mutiny, Cap'n. We're leavin' ya.
C4GT310	Did I mention that I'm offering my crew a very attractive pension plan?
C4HM311	Aye, ya did. And the stock options. But we're still leavin'.
C4GT312	But why, Haggis? Why?
C4HM313	Well, I admit bein' yer pirate crew has been a real pleasure. A real pleasure.
C4HM314	But we've grown restless.
C4HM315	We can hear the voice o' the siren callin' ta us and she says she be wantin' us to do her hair!
C4GT316	You're going back to being barbers?
C4HM317	Aye. We'll be sailin' back to Plunder Island just as soon as we can fix the ship.
C4HM318	Good luck, Cap'n Driftwood. It were a pleasure ta be lootin' with ya.
C4GT319	I guess I'm on my own again.
CIGT301	It says, `Ask Me About Grim Fandango.`
CIBB302	Wait one second!
CIBB303	Do ya have me gold tooth?
CIGT304	Um... no?
CIBB305	Let me see.
CIBB306	Ye don't have it!
CIBB307	Darn. I'll have to order a new one.
CIGT308	I wonder where that tooth fell.
CIGT309	You know, I bet I could chug all these guys in one gulp.
CIGT310	Drop and give me twenty, YOU MAGGOTS!
CIGT311	Mmmmmm... maggoty.
CIGT312	Eeeew!
CIGT313	This biscuit is full of... maggots!
CIBB314	Aye! Ha-Ha! That's me special ingredient!
CIBB315	Adds just the right amount of exotic flavor!
CIBB316	It's a good thing, too, 'cause I can't keep 'em out of the food around here.
CIBB317	Do ya have a reservation?
CISO318	Of course I have a reservation!
CISO319	Uh...No.
CIBB320	Then let's see your reservation slip!
CIBB321	No reservation slip, huh?
CIBB322	Then out you go.
CIBB323	Gotta make way for paying customers.
CIGT324	All right, all right! I'm leaving.
CIBB325	Very good.
CIBB326	You may seat yourself, Mr...uh...
CIBB327	...pardon me...
CIBB328	...Mrs. Brinestoop.
CIBB329	Do ya have a reserva...
CIBB330	Madre de Dios! Es El Pollo Diablo!
CISO331	Qué?
CISO332	Huh?
CISO333	Yes! I have released your prisoners and now I've come for you!
CISO334	Si! He dejado en libertad los prisioneros y ahora vengo por ti!
CIBB335	It's El Pollo Diablo, the giant demon chicken of Puerto Pollo!
CIBB336	You weren't content just to release all my chickens and scare all my customers away, were you?
CIGT337	Uh, that's right.
CIBB338	Well, you're not taking me without a fight!
CIPN339	At this point, Blondebeard hits Guybrush over the head, rendering him unconscious.
CIPN340	Because he has no time to clean Guybrush and prepare him, he puts him in a large bucket...
CIPN341	...and delivers him to LeChimp's ship.
CIGT342	Bucket-O-Booty:
CIGT343	A Captain-sized bucket of eyes, beaks, and talons.
CIGT344	The Admiral's Bucket:
CIGT345	Only the most important parts o' chicken...
CIGT346	...the insides, fried golden brown.
CIGT347	The Swingin' Pirate Bucket:
CIGT348	A whole bucket o' long chicken necks.
CIGT349	The Skinless Chicken Bucket:
CIGT350	Blondebeard's Chicken Shoppe is proud to serve skinless chicken.
CIGT351	We're also proud to serve the skins.
CIGT352	Traditional Grog:
CIGT353	Brewed the old-fashioned way...
CIGT354	...the unsanitary way.
CIGT355	Old GrandPappy:
CIGT356	Made from actual distilled old men.
CIGT357	Heifer-Wizen Grog:
CIGT358	A lighter grog distilled from wheat, alfalfa, and other grains...
CIGT359	...which have been `processed' by free-range heifers.
CIGT360	Caribbean Kiwi Grog:
CIGT361	A fruity, Caribbean splash of taste and color.
CIGT362	Blondebeard's Super Slaw:
CIGT363	Our own blend of shredded palm fronds and seaweed.
CIGT364	Blondebeard's Mashed `Taters':
CIGT365	Mashed chitin and flour mixed with coconut milk.
CIGT366	You'll say, `I can't believe these aren't real potatoes.'
CIGT367	Golden Bounty Gravy:
CIGT368	Aged to perfection.
CIGT369	Tasty Buttery Biscuits.
CIGT370	Say...
CIGT371	...I think I'd like to try one of those!
CIGT372	Ick...
CIGT373	...I know all about those already!
CIGT374	Hey! Mister.
CIGT375	Mister, are you listening?
CIGT376	Ah!
CIGT377	It's one of LeChuck's skeletal horde!
CIBB378	Aye!
CIBB379	I fixed his little red dinghy, but good!
CIGT380	Mmmm. The undead that walk among us must surely be destroyed lest their evil like...
CIGT381	...overrun and befoul the world of the living.
CIBB382	Aye.
CIBB383	And he complained about me chicken.
CIGT384	Oh.
CISQ385	Waiter, what's this metatarsal doing in my soup?
CISQ386	Uh, check, please!
CIBB387	Ah, that meat flavored gum be lookin' mighty, mighty temptin'.
CIBB388	But right now, I be havin' this insane cravin' fer somethin' crunchy.
CIBB389	Somethin' ta crack m'teeth on.
CIBB390	Somethin' crispy and crackly, like me mouth-waterin' tongue-torturin' 'chicken'n'lighter-fluid special.'
CIBB391	Aye! If I hadn't lost all me chickens I could be savoring that succulent bit o' squab right now.
CIBB392	Hey!
CIBB393	Where do ye think ye're going in such a hurry?
CIBB394	I don't suppose ye know where me missing gold tooth be?
CIGT395	Er...
CIGT396	No.
CIBB397	Then what do ye call that then?
CIGT398	Oh... that.
CIGT399	I thought it was a rock in my shoe.
CIGT400	I was going to take it outside.
CIBB401	Sure ya was!
CIBB402	Give it back.
CIBB403	What be ya havin' in yer hand there?
CIGT404	Well, what do you know? It's your gold tooth!
CIBB405	Give it o'er!
CIGT406	Would you like this jawbreaker?
CIBB407	Thanks, ta ye.
CIBB408	Ouch!
CIBB409	I think I loosed me gold tooth!
CIBB410	Arrrgh! I knew sweets were bein' bad fer me teeth.
CIBB411	But it had a fine crunch and were a fiesta-o-flavor!
CIBB412	From now on, I'll be sticking to fleshier foodstuffs.
CIBB413	Somethin'...somethin' chewy!
CIBB414	Well, there I go again!
CIBB415	This ol' salts got a cravin' fer somethin' ta squish 'tween me teeth!
CIGT416	Would you like some gum?
CIGT417	More gum?
CIBB418	Thanks.
CIBB419	Mmmmm...
CIBB420	This is really good steak-flavored gum!
CIBB421	It gets ya here!
CIBB422	And it gets ya right here!
CIBB423	Got some already. Thanks.
CIBB424	Why ye little scamp!
CIBB425	Haha. That's quite a funny trick ye've played on old Cap'n Blondebeard!
CIBB426	Haha! Popped me bubble did ye?
CIBB427	Ya got me again!
CIGT428	What can you tell me about `Grim Fandango?`
CIGT429	Anything?
CIGT430	I don't like to speak ill of the dead...
CIGT431	...but this guy's lousy at marketing.
CIGT432	Excuse me...
CIGT433	Sir?
CIGT434	Now that's just rude.
CIGT435	He's not much of a talker.
CISQ436	Braaakk!
CIBB437	What was that?!
CISQ438	It is I, the spirit of El Pollo Diablo!
CIBB439	Back! Back you fowl demon!
CIGT440	Just kidding.
CIBB441	Why ye little scamp!
CIBB442	Stop foolin' kindly ol' Captain Blondebeard now.
CINZ443	gross chicken
CIGT444	This is the greasiest, crustiest, most revolting chicken I've ever seen!
CIBB445	Ahhh! Yes!
CIBB446	He got our blackened, Cajun-style chicken!
CIGT447	I can't eat that. The fumes alone would kill me.
CIGT448	I don't even like looking at it, much less touching it.
CIGT449	No. This chicken is too hard to be damaged by mere metal.
CINZ450	club card
CIGT451	`Brimstone Beach Club`
CIGT452	`Member since 1632`
CIGT453	It's a membership card to the Brimstone Beach Club.
CIGT454	I don't need a membership card for that.
CIGT455	This proves I'm a member.
CINZ456	biscuit barrel
CIGT457	`Biscuits and More.`
CIGT458	I wonder what the `more` is.
CIGT459	It's a maggot-infested biscuit barrel.
CIGT460	I don't need a whole barrel.
CIGT461	I'll just take one.
CIGT462	I don't need any more biscuits.
CIGT463	I don't want any maggot-filled biscuits!
CIGT464	I'd rather just eat one at a time.
CINZ465	tasty, buttery biscuit
CIGT466	That looks delicious.
CIGT467	I want to keep this biscuit. I may get hungry later.
CIGT468	How should I use this biscuit?
CIGT469	That seems like a waste of a perfectly good biscuit.
CINZ470	maggots
CIGT471	It's a good heaping handful of healthy, wriggling maggots.
CIGT472	I shouldn't waste good maggots.
CIGT473	I could squish these little guys...
CIGT474	...but they're kind of cute.
CINZ475	Captain Blondebeard
CIGT476	It's the owner of the shop.
CIGT477	He's got a gold tooth.
CIGT478	It's the owner of this shop.
CIBB479	No, thanks. Not until I find me tooth.
CIBB480	I hate to be sounding ungrateful, but couldn't I have a fresh piece?
CIBB481	No, thanks. Not until I find me tooth.
CIBB482	Ah, ye've found it! Thanks.
CINZ483	bubble
CIGT484	I don't feel close enough to Blondebeard to be chewing his gum.
CIGT485	I don't want gum all over my hands.
CIGT487	I'm afraid I might slip and cut him.
CINZ488	gold tooth
CIGT489	It's a gold tooth.
CIGT490	I don't need a gold tooth. I've still got all my originals.
CIGT491	This gold tooth won't do any good there.
CIGT492	This gold tooth feels slimy.
CIGT493	The gold tooth is in the gum.
CIGT494	The gum is too hard.
CINZ495	window
CIGT496	It's the window to the outside.
CIGT497	It's too high for me to reach.
CIGT498	Nah, he would see me throw it.
CINZ499	tooth in gum
CIGT500	It's a gold tooth in some gum.
CINZ501	biscuit cutter
CIGT502	It's a round biscuit cutter.
CIGT503	This biscuit cutter won't do any good there.
CIGT504	With what should I use this biscuit cutter?
CINZ505	pie pan
CIGT506	It's a heavy pie pan.
CIGT507	It's a pie pan.
CIGT508	It's a heavy pie pan full of shaving cream.
CIGT509	It's a pie pan full of shaving cream.
CIGT510	This pie pan won't do any good there.
CIGT511	There is nothing in this pie pan.
CIGT512	What can I do with a heavy pie pan?
CIGT513	I think we're above that kind of obvious humor.
CIGT514	It sure FEELS like a pie.
CIGT515	Now I've got a heavy pie pan full of shaving cream.
CINN516	heavy fake pie
CIGT517	I've got a pie pan full of shaving cream.
CINN518	fake pie
CIGT519	It's already full of shaving cream.
CIGT520	Now it's a heavy pie pan.
CINN521	heavy pie pan
CIGT522	Now it's a heavy pie pan full of shaving cream.
CINN523	heavy fake pie
CINZ524	quiet patron
CIGT525	He's awfully reserved for a pirate.
CIGT526	This whole sordid scene has litigation written all over it.
CIGT527	He's dead! I don't want to touch him.
CINZ528	very quiet patron
CIGT529	I think he's had enough.
CIGT530	He already looks pretty decomposed.
CINZ531	serrated bread knife
CIGT532	It's a very sharp knife.
CIGT533	This serrated knife won't work here.
CIGT534	Boy, is that sharp.
CINZ535	hideous portrait
CIGT536	Demon chicken, I rebuke you!
CINZ537	buckets-o-chicken menu
CIGT538	It does look good enough to eat, but figuratively.

CIGT540	I don't want to chew on that.

CINZ542	value meal menu
CIGT543	Value Meal: Two drumsticks plus super slaw.
CIGT544	Looks like a fine deal if you like slaw.
CINZ545	reservation book
CIGT546	It's the reservation book for the restaurant.
CIGT547	It looks too heavy to carry around.
CINZ548	podium
CIGT549	It's the maître d' podium.
CIGT550	It's not for giving speeches.
CINZ551	ship in bottle
CIGT552	I wish that was a real ship that I could use to sail to Blood Island.
CIGT553	I can't reach that high.
CIGT554	I can't talk to a ship in a bottle.
CINZ555	ship in bottle

CIGT559	I don't want people always asking me about Grim Fandango.
CDSO301	What's so special about the treasure of Big Whoop?
CDSO302	But how will Big Whoop make Elaine love you?
CDSO303	But if you kill Elaine, won't she hate you even more?
CDSO304	This whole amusement park...why?
CDSO305	How did you find Big Whoop?
CDSO306	All right. Tell me how you found Big Whoop.
CDSO307	I'm still confused about the carnival...
CDSO308	What happened to Captain Marley and his crew?
CDSO309	I have another question about Captain Marley and his crew?
CDSO310	What is the secret of Monkey Island?
CDSO311	Please don't kill me.
CDSO312	Pretty please don't kill me.
CDSO313	Elaine will never marry you! She loves me!
CDSO314	Anyway, Elaine really loves me.
CDSO315	Does too love me!
CDSO316	Does too. Infinity.
CDSO317	I've heard enough of your evil stories! Let's get this over with!
CDLC318	Where was I...
CDLC319	Ah, yes!
CDLC320	What?
CDLC321	Then ask me. As designer and founder, I can answer all your questions.
CDGT322	I'VE HEARD QUITE ENOUGH ABOUT YOUR DISGUSTING THEME PARK!
CDSO323	How did you build an amusement park on a deserted island?
CDSO324	What kind of attractions do you have?
CDSO325	How do you power all the rides?
CDSO326	What's in the future for Big Whoop theme parks?
CDSO327	I thought the treasure of Big Whoop was on Dinky Island.
CDSO328	Who told you this was a good idea? You're insane!
CDSO329	Don't tell me any more!
CDLC330	Maybe, Threepwood. Maybe. But I did it all for love.
CDLC331	I'm mad for ye, Elaine, and I'm not ashamed to admit it!
CDLC332	Dinky Island be an atoll, just off the coast a Monkey Island.
CDLC333	But they be connected by a maze o' mysterious tunnels that run under the very ocean floor.
CDLC334	So although ye dug fer treasure on Dinky, when ye found me carnival ye were on Monkey Island. (Laugh)
CDGT335	Very tidy explanation.
CDLC336	Aye!
CDLC337	The process begins with a winning design team.
CDLC338	I scoured the Caribbean, looking for the best and brightest artists, engineers and creative people.
CDLC339	After a lengthy period of intensive recruitment, intimidation, (Laugh) and murder...
CDLC340	...I had me team at work slashing and burning acres of old-growth timberland on Monkey and Dinky Islands.
CDGT341	That must have been back-breaking work!
CDLC342	Aye, that it was.
CDLC343	Fortunately, hundreds of men were lost to malaria, wild animals or construction accidents. (Laugh)  Argh!
CDLC344	Here at Big Whoop, we pride ourselves on the variety and authenticity of our attractions.
CDLC345	We be usin' a magical blend of art, technology, and indentured servitude that we like to call...
CDLC346	...Dynamo-Monkelectrics.
CDLC347	Frighteningly realistic skins and other body parts are attached to a framework of gears, servos, and pulleys.
CDLC348	All constructed from a remarkably lightweight composite material.
CDGT349	Fascinating.
CDLC350	That be a good question.
CDLC351	As ye may already know, the power of Big Whoop be derived from its position as an infernal nexus binding our world with the unholy manifestation of Evil itself.
CDGT352	Well, of course.
CDLC353	But, like all fuel sources, it can't be lastin' forever.
CDLC354	That's why it be our job to conserve its demonic power wherever possible and look to alternative power sources.
CDSO355	Solar?
CDSO356	Wind?
CDSO357	Hydroelectric?
CDSO358	Fossil fuels?
CDSO359	Nuclear?
CDLC360	No, we tap our greatest natural resource...
CDLC361	Monkeys!
CDGT362	My word!
CDLC363	Hordes of ruthlessly-trained monkeys are hidden away deep within the bowels of the park...
CDLC364	...bound to immense machines of destruction and family entertainment.
CDGT365	That's so inhumane!
CDLC366	Oooh, I'm glad ye noticed. It be the little touches that make the difference. (Laugh)
CDGT367	Mark my words, LeChuck! When I finally defeat you, I'll be sure to set them all free.
CDLC368	Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Laugh)
CDLC369	The future is ripe with a world of possibilities!
CDLC370	I see an entire network of theme parks throughout the world!
CDLC371	Each will be unique and incorporate the cultures and customs of its specific area, but all will hold true to the same vision of the original park:
CDLC372	The random, wholesale slaughter of the thousands of patrons who walk through our gates.
CDLC373	She does not! She loves me.
CDGT374	Nuh-uh. She loves me.
CDLC375	Does not.
CDLC376	Does... Aarrrggh!
CDLC377	Curse you and your diabolical debate skills!
CDLC378	Does not.
CDLC379	Why shouldn't I?
CDGT380	If you kill me... 
CDGT381	...you'll crush the hopes of children all over the world!
CDGT382	...you'll be in really big trouble.
CDGT383	...there'll be no more Monkey Island sequels.
CDGT384	...you'll ruin our reputation for making family-oriented games.
CDSO385	...you'll crush the hopes of children all over the world!
CDSO386	...you'll be in really big trouble.
CDSO387	...there'll be no more Monkey Island sequels.
CDSO388	...you'll ruin our reputation for making family-oriented games.
CDGT389	I'm a hero to millions.
CDLC390	It doesn't matter!
CDLC391	All that matters is that Elaine and I are together... 
CDLC392	...and you are out of the picture for good!
CDLC393	I'm one of the walking dead!
CDLC394	Formed not of flesh and blood, but of fire and brimstone!
CDLC395	How could I be in any more trouble?
CDGT396	Yeah, well...
CDGT397	No sequels means no work for you.
CDGT398	You'll become just another has-been that nobody's heard of.
CDLC399	That could never happen to ME! I'm LeChuck!
CDGT400	Do you know the name `Bobbin Threadbare`?
CDLC401	Uh, no.
CDGT402	Exactly.
CDGT403	We'll be scorned by parent watchdog groups everywhere.
CDLC404	What'll ye threaten me with next?
CDLC405	Some ludicrous Senate subcommittee investigatin' violence in the media?
CDLC406	Well, I'm shakin' in me boots now! (Laugh)
CDLC407	Their ship arrived at Monkey Island a half-hour after mine.
CDLC408	But they were too late to stop me from claiming me prize...
CDLC409	...and they watched me pass through the portal of Big Whoop!
CDLC410	Craven cowards that they were, the power of what they saw overwhelmed them.
CDLC411	They fled the island in terror!
CDLC412	Marley tore his treasure map into four pieces and gathered his crew around him.
CDLC413	There was Rum Rogers, Sr., the first mate...
CDLC414	...Rapp Scallion, the cook...
CDLC415	...and Young Lindy, the cabin boy.
CDLC416	Marley gave each a piece of the map, keeping one for himself.
CDLC417	They promised to guard those map pieces with their lives.
CDLC418	(Laugh) I saw to it that they kept their promise.
CDLC419	They were the only people alive to know about Big Whoop.
CDGT420	You're unbelievably ghastly and wretched!
CDLC421	Oh, thanks.  (Laugh)
CDSO422	What happened to Rum Rogers, Sr.?
CDSO423	What happened to Rapp Scallion, the cook?
CDSO424	What became of Young Lindy, the cabin boy?
CDSO425	What fate befell Captain Marley?
CDSO426	Enough back story! Let's move on.
CDSO427	Actually, I've heard enough about Marley and his crew.
CDLC428	Rapp Scallion died in a flash fire in his weenie hut on Scabb Island.
CDGT429	That's right! I brought him back to life with a voodoo spell! I remember it so vividly...
CDLC430	Guybrush?
CDGT431	Oh, I'm sorry, I was miles away. What were you saying?
CDLC432	I knew about Rapp's absent-minded tendency to leave his gas burners on...
CDLC433	...so I arranged for a fully-lit cake to be delivered to him on his thirty-fifth birthday. (Laugh)
CDLC434	Ye could hear the explosion as far as Booty Island.
CDGT435	That's horrible!
CDLC436	`Steamin' Weenie` indeed.
CDLC437	Fearin' fer his life, he came to me and begged for mercy.
CDLC438	In return for not revealing the location of Big Whoop, I let him live.
CDLC439	As a sign of me `gratitude,` I gave him a fortune which he used it to build a successful advertising firm.
CDLC440	Once he had grown accustomed to his wealthy lifestyle, I returned to collect me debt.
CDLC441	I delivered to him an account so demonically ill-conceived that it was doomed to fail.
CDLC442	Gangrene 'n' Honey.
CDLC443	Within a month, he was penniless and insane, a broken man.
CDLC444	He sold everything he owned and got so desperate he fell in with a traveling circus.
CDLC445	He was killed when he was shot from a cannon without a helmet.
CDGT446	No one could be THAT desperate!
CDLC447	I ambushed him while he was racing in the America's Cup.
CDLC448	I boarded his ship and decided to let him determine his own fate.
CDLC449	He could grant me his blessing to have his granddaughter's hand in marriage...
CDLC450	...or he could suffer a death more horrible than any of his crewmates'.
CDGT451	Well? What'd he say?
CDLC452	Actually, he said quite a few things...
CDLC453	'Oh, the pain!'
CDLC454	'Stop it, you're killing me!'
CDEM455	Ffrrgghhh!
CDLC456	Some other things. I forget them all.
CDLC457	I left him for dead and sent his ship into a whirlpool not even the most accomplished captain could escape.
CDEM458	Grrggbbhhh!
CDLC459	He was takin' a bath in his cabin near Phatt Island...
CDLC460	...drinking rum and eatin' toast, as he always did while bathing...
CDLC461	...when the toaster `mysteriously` fell into the tub with him.
CDGT462	Shocking.
CDLC463	His son inherited the map piece, but was too much of a drunkard to understand its importance. (Laugh)
CDLC464	That be a long story. Are ye sure ye want ta hear it?
CDGT465	Does the torture start after we're done talking here?
CDLC466	Aye.
CDGT467	Go on, then.
CDLC468	Back when I were alive, Elaine despised me.
CDGT469	No!
CDLC470	No, no. It's true. I can see that now. She didn't like me at all.
CDLC471	But I were determined ta prove me worth ta her, ya see.
CDLC472	So I set sail ta find the legendary Secret of Monkey Island!
CDSO473	Been there. Done that.
CDSO474	What is the Secret of Monkey Island?
CDSO475	Actually, I think torture would be BETTER than this story.
CDLC476	Well, I did it first ya nefarious nudibranch!
CDLC477	Ye'll regret that, Threepwood!
CDLC478	The Secret of Monkey Island?
CDLC479	I COULD tell you, but I'd rather make ye guess.
CDSO480	That 'Rosebud' is a sled?
CDSO481	That the guy's girlfriend is really a man?
CDSO482	That they have to shoot the dog at the end?
CDSO483	That it's made from people?
CDSO484	That the girl is her daughter AND her sister?
CDSO485	That a sequel can never be as good as the original?
CDLC486	That's not it. Everyone knows that.
CDLC487	Now you're just being foolish.
CDLC488	Oh, why'd ye have to remind me about that?
CDLC489	(sniff) Ya know what that story does to me.
CDLC490	I have no idea what you're talking about.
CDLC491	What are you talking about?
CDLC492	Lies! Filthy, dirty lies!
CDLC493	No, it goes much deeper than that.
CDLC494	It's an ancient secret, closely guarded by the natives and pirates who happened to...
CDGT495	You don't even know The Secret of Monkey Island, do you?
CDLC496	No...not really.
CDGT497	All right, then.
CDGT498	Let's get on with your story.
CDLC499	A few days after settin' sail, me ship was caught in a terrible typhoon and was torn apart!
CDLC500	I would have drowned, but some friendly sharks found me and set me ashore on Blood Island.
CDLC501	There I was marooned, with no hope o' winnin' Elaine's heart!
CDLC502	I thought me luck had run out, but one day a ship made port at Blood Island.
CDLC503	'Twas the ship of one Captain Marley, Elaine's own grandfather!
CDLC504	I struck up a conversation with Rum Rogers Sr., first mate on the ship.
CDLC505	And for the price of a few drinks, I learned that they had the map to the legendary treasure of Big Whoop.
CDLC506	Although I had no ship and no money...
CDGT507	Hold on.
CDSO508	Does this go on for much longer?
CDSO509	Can I sit down? Both my legs are going to sleep.
CDSO510	You know, you could make a fortune as a sleeping aid.
CDSO511	I'm sorry. Were you saying something?
CDLC512	ALTHOUGH I HAD NO SHIP AND NO MONEY...
CDLC513	...I planned to beat Marley's crew to the treasure and take it fer meself.
CDLC514	I didn't have the money to buy a new ship, but I still had me greatest asset...
CDSO515	The ability to kill bugs just by breathing?
CDSO516	Your resemblance to a moray eel?
CDSO517	That your presence makes dumb people seem much smarter?
CDSO518	Your immunity to soap?
CDLC519	...BUT I STILL HAD ME GREATEST ASSET...
CDLC520	...that indefinable LeChuck charm.
CDLC521	One of the rich young debutantes on Blood Island was helpless against it.
CDLC522	After a week with me, she would've followed me to the grave.
CDLC523	Unfortunately for her, she didn't get the chance.
CDLC524	I pried the diamond from her family's engagement ring and sold it to some cutthroat smugglers for the cost of a new ship.
CDSO525	You scum!
CDSO526	You scoundrel!
CDSO527	You ruffian!
CDSO528	You cad!
CDSO529	You big old bed-wetting doody-head!
CDSO530	All right, LeChuck! Was she hot? Did you kiss her?
CDLC531	Well, I... uh...
CDGT532	Oh, come on. You can tell me.
CDLC533	I don't want ta talk about that. It be personal.
CDLC534	And besides...dead men tell no tales.
CDGT535	Oh! I was waitin' for that one!
CDLC536	Hmph! I've been called worse.
CDLC537	With me new ship, I easily overtook Marley's crew and beat them to Big Whoop, which just so happened ta be here on Monkey Island.
CDLC538	The Big Whoop Carnival was me most brilliant idea!
CDLC539	Once I had the power of Big Whoop at my command, I could make Elaine mine at last!
CDGT540	I see. But again, why an amusement park?
CDLC541	I'll be gettin' to that.
CDLC542	I knew Elaine would need a little coaxing, and that I'd be needing an army.
CDLC543	A horrible army of the undead!
CDGT544	Okay, but why an amusement park?
CDLC545	Are ye goin' ta let me finish? I'm not talking just to hear myself talk, you know.
CDGT546	You're right. I've been rude. Please go on.
CDLC547	Everyone knows that the life of a seaman is a long, hard, lonely one.
CDLC548	Sailors spend months longing for just a few days' leave, and you know what they're lookin' for soon as they get into port! Eh?
CDSO549	Uh...?
CDSO550	Err...?
CDSO551	Why... ah...?
CDSO552	Yes...?
CDLC553	A family-oriented fun park!
CDGT554	Oh, that. He, he, he. Of course.
CDLC555	They come to take a ride on the giant roller coaster... The Great Monkey Mountain!
CDLC556	They reach the top of the highest peak, and then hands in the air, screaming like monkeys...
CDLC557	They plunge down the slope into a great stream of lava!
CDGT558	That doesn't sound the least bit fun.
CDLC559	Aye, it's not. In fact, it's downright unpleasant.
CDLC560	But when they reach the other side, they're fitting warriors for my skeletal army of the damned!
CDLC561	Aye, at first.
CDLC562	But soon she'll be understandin' what a grand gift eternal life be!
CDLC563	And besides...
CDLC564	...the dating pool be surprisingly small when ye're the livin' dead.
CDLC565	She'll just have to give me another chance!
CDLC566	Elaine shall pass through the hoary gates of Big Whoop...just as I once did...
CDLC567	...down ta the inky blackness of the infernal nether regions.
CDLC568	For ya see...Big Whoop gives those who pass through it the greatest gift of all -- immortality!
CDGT569	But... at... what... cost?
CDLC570	Cost? Pah!
CDLC571	Granted, people may find me a bit unapproachable now...
CDLC572	...and the smell does take a while to get used to...
CDLC573	...but it be worth everything, now that I have the power to make Elaine love me!
CDGT574	Isn't it just like any other pirate treasure?
CDLC575	I see...Ye do not yet know the dreadful power that be Big Whoop!
CDGT576	I guess not.
CDLC577	Quake in fear Threepwood, when I tell thee that Big Whoop be a damned portal to a demon netherworld!
CDGT578	O.K.
CDLC579	The treasures of Big Whoop be THE VERY GATES OF HELL THEMSELVES!
CDGT580	Yipe!
CDLC581	But thar be so many more horrible things I be wantin' ta tell ye!
CDGT582	I'm not listening to you anymore.
CDGT583	See? I'm ignoring you.
CDLC584	Arrgh! Ye'd better listen!
CDSO585	I'm not listening. I'm not listening.
CDSO586	LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA
CDSO587	I can't hear you. I can't hear you.
CDSO588	Did somebody say something? I didn't hear anything.
KTGT301	Now you're sure about this?
KTLF302	Oh, yeah! You don't look that heavy at all.
KTGT303	Hmmm.
KTLF304	Is that knot tied securely?
KTGT305	Please be careful this time.
KTLF306	No problem!
KTLF307	Here we go!
KTGT308	Okay, give me a little bit more slack.
KTLF309	Whoops!
KTLF310	I got it!
KTLF311	I got it!
KTGT312	Okay, that's too much slack.
KTLF313	I don't got it.
KTLF314	Whoops!

KTGT316	There's a cave down there in the cliff face.
KTGT317	I could never climb down there without falling.

KTGT320	I bet he can help me find the Smugglers' Cave.

CTGT312	It's already open.
CTGT313	It'd be easier to cut through it from the outside.
CTGT314	I don't want to ruin the glass.

CTGT316	It's the face that I cut out of the Goodsoup portrait.
CTGT317	I can't use the portrait face with that.
CTGT318	Canvasy.

CTGT320	I don't have any use for portraits of the VanSalad family.
CAGT301	The chalk doesn't look that tasty.
CAGT302	They're just chalked on the grass.
CAGT303	These are distance markers for the caber toss.
CAGT304	Those are too big to be toothpicks.
CAGT305	I could never hope to move that.
CAGT306	I don't think that would fit in my pants.
CAVH307	IT'S EL POLLO DIABLO!
CAVH308	KILL HIM!
CAGT309	Uh oh!
CAVH310	You're pretty good, boy!
CAVH311	Let's see you follow this!
CAGT312	He's good.
CAGT313	I'll never beat him.
CAGT314	I choose this pistol.
CAVH315	Since you had the effrontery to challenge me... 
CAVH316	I will take the first shot.
CAGT317	If I beat you, will you join my crew?
CAVH318	The odds of you beating me are SO astronomical, I will take that bet.
CAPN319	gun is shot from guybrush's hand
CAVH320	Haha! Again I prove to you that I am the greatest duelist in the world!
CAVH321	I win again!
CAVH322	I'll just clear this stuff away.
CAVH323	Choose yer weapon.
CAVH324	I'll go first.
CAPN325	Blam!
CAVH326	What!
CAVH327	You shot my banjo!
CAGT328	You can't be sure of that.
CAGT329	That shot may have come from the grassy knoll.
CAVH330	Of all the low-down tricks!
CAVH331	I've never heard of anything so low.
CAVH332	I completely misjudged you!
CAVH333	You are a pirate after all!
CAVH334	I'd be proud to join your crew!
CAGT335	Great!
CAVH336	I'll just pack this stuff up and get ready.
CAVH337	And give me back my gun.
CAPN338	Guybrush throws pathetically!
CAHM339	I would never follow such a weak captain!
CAHM340	Ye'll have to throw farther, if ya want me ta join yer crew!
CAPN341	Here Guybrush barely picks up the rubber caber.
CAPN342	He drops it and it bounces past McMutton's caber.
CAGT343	Hey, I win!
CAHM344	By the spiraling bouffant of me great uncle McManus!
CAHM345	Never before have I seen such strength!
CAHM346	Sure I'll join yer crew! I'll wait at the shop until you're ready to leave.
CAGT347	Curious pile of logs there...
CAGT348	They look like they are made out of palm tree trunks.
CAGT349	I wonder if they have anything to do with these lines chalked on the ground?
CAGT350	These are cabers...
CAGT351	They are made from palm trees.
CAGT352	They look pretty tough to toss.
CAGT353	I'm not contesting the caber toss right now.
CAGT354	Pshaw!
CAVH355	Hey!
CAVH356	That's one of my favorite pistols.
CAVH357	Give it back!
CAGT358	I only need one plug.
CAGT359	There's not enough left of the tree.
CAGT360	Hi!
CAGT361	Yoo-Hoo!
CAGT362	Over Here!
CAGT363	Yip Yip Yip!
CAGT364	That's All, Folks!
CAGT365	I've had quite enough of that nonsense.
CAGT366	I wonder what these numbers are for?
CAGT367	They remind me of something that I saw on Booty Island...
CAGT368	I wonder if they have anything to do with these piles of lumber?

CBGT315	I like rum as much as the next pirate, but that's a little much.
CBGT316	Naw. I need to keep a clear head for now.
CBGT317	If I cut the keg all the rum will spill out.
CBNZ318	sawhorse
CBGT319	It's a wooden sawhorse supporting that keg of rum.
CBGT320	It's too heavy for me to move.
CBGT321	I can't saw this horse with scissors.
CBNZ322	keg
CBNZ323	trail of rum
CBGT324	It's a trail of rum leaking from the keg.
CBGT325	I think even I have too much dignity for that.
CBNZ326	log pile
CBGT327	Those are too big to be toothpicks.
CBGT328	I'm not contesting the caber toss right now.
CBGT329	Pshaw!
CWGT301	That won't do any good right now.
CWMR302	(giggle)
CWMR303	This is going to be so cool!
CWMR304	(snicker)
CWMR305	(giggle)
CWGT306	Hi, Murray.
CWMR307	Ohhh... it hurts...
CWMR308	DIIIIEEEE!!!
CWMR309	Ohhh... I'm not going to do that again...
CWMR310	I think I broke my skull. I'm all skull.
CWGT311	It's your own fault!
CWGT312	Stop scaring me like that!
CWMR313	So I did scare you? Really?
CWGT314	Well, startled is more like it.
CWMR315	Ohhhhh...
CWGT316	But, but startled in a terrified kind of way!
CWGT317	You really are very very scary!
CWMR318	Don't talk down to me!
CWGT319	I really don't have any choice.
CWMR320	I saw you get out of that crypt. Does this mean that you're dead?
CWGT321	No, I was only faking.
CWMR322	Darn. I thought together we could walk among the living and spawn a new wave of terror throughout the Caribbean.
CWGT323	So what you're saying is that you only love me for my legs.
CWMR324	Something like that.
CWGT325	Ahhh! My arm's stuck! My circulation is cut off!
CWGT326	You're going to have to cut off my hand!
CWGT327	No, no. Just kidding.
CWNZ328	crack
CWGT329	The crowbar won't work on solid stone.
CWGT330	It would take forever to chisel my way out of here.
CWGT331	I can't see where the arm is going from here.
CWNZ332	crowbar
CWGT333	It's a universal crowbar.
CWGT334	I can't use the crowbar with that.
CWGT335	I need to use the crowbar with something else.
CWNZ336	coffin lid
CWGT337	Nice coffin lid.
CWNZ338	lantern
CWGT339	It's a glowing lantern.
CWGT340	It's out of oil.
CWGT341	It's giving off enough light where it is.
CWGT342	It's useless now that it's out of oil.
CWGT343	There's no light to cast Murray's shadow.
CWNZ344	crack
CWNZ345	crack
CWNZ346	crack
CWNZ347	crack
CWNZ348	family crest
CWGT349	`Goodsoup is Food`
CWGT350	I don't want to get my fingerprints all over it.
CWNZ351	family crest
CWNZ352	family crest
CWNZ353	bowl
CWGT354	Looks like minestrone, delicately seasoned with cobwebs and mouse knuckles.
CWGT355	No, really, I couldn't. I'm full.
CWGT356	It's probably gotten cold.
CWNZ357	bowl
CWGT358	It's vegetable soup with... raisins?
CWGT359	I don't feel comfortable stealing the soup of the dead.
CWGT360	It doesn't look the least bit appetizing.
CWNZ361	Murray
CWGT362	I don't want to get caught up in a conversation with Murray right now.
CWGT363	He just can't stop jammering.
CWGT364	It's Murray.
CWGT365	Alas, I can't use Murray with that.
CWMR366	Hey! Watch the hands!
CWGT367	Reuniting Murray with his arm is a BAD idea.
CWMR368	Hey!
DANZ301	beach
DANZ302	pirate ship
DBGT301	It won't stay in there.
DBGT302	I can't plug that up.
DBGT303	I need something else to plug up.
DBGT304	Wow, for a home-made rubber plug, that worked very... 
DBGT305	...nicely.
DBGT306	Perfect!
DBGT307	The waterfall washed off all the tar and feathers.
DBGT308	I feel fresh and clean as a spring morning now!
DBNZ309	pirate ship
DBGT310	Those must be the pirates who've taken Elaine!
DBGT311	It's The Sea Cucumber.
DBGT312	Hey! You guys! Come back here!
DBNZ313	boat
DBGT314	It's a nice boat except for that enormous gaping hole in the bottom.
DBGT315	Looks watertight to me.
DBGT316	It's got a huge hole in the bottom. I'd sink.
DBGT317	I'd better not now. I think I'm starting to make those guys angry.
DBNZ318	gaping hole
DBGT319	It makes the boat completely unseaworthy.
DBGT320	I'd get a nasty splinter.
DBGT321	I don't have enough gum to plug a hole that big.
DBGT322	It's the right size, but I can't plug the hole with this.
DBNZ323	rubber plug
DBGT324	It's a large rubber plug.
DBNZ325	sticky rubber plug
DBGT326	It's a large rubber plug with paste all over it.
DBNZ327	waterfall
DBGT328	It's wet.
DBGT329	Curiously refreshing.
DBNZ330	Danjer Bay
DBGT331	It's the bay.
DBGT332	I'll be cut to ribbons by those sharks if I go in there.
DGSO301	Are you the real Dinghy Dog?
DGSO302	Don't you patronize me.
DGSO303	How can I win one of these fabulous prizes?
DGSO304	Just try to guess how much I weigh.
DGSO305	Bet you can't guess how old I am.
DGSO306	I want to try for another prize.
DGSO307	I'd like to speak to your manager.
DGSO308	I really want to talk to somebody in charge.
DGSO309	I need to get on the roller coaster!
DGSO310	Let me on the roller coaster!
DGSO311	Keep up the good work.
DGDD312	(Hyuk!) You bet I am, and I'm here to make sure you have fun fun FUN!
DGDD313	What's your name, little boy?
DGGT314	Okay, for starters, I'm not a little boy.
DGGT315	I'm Guybrush Threepwood. Mighty Pirate.
DGDD316	Well, shiver me timbers! That's swell!
DGDD317	Well! (Hyuk!) Sounds like you've learned a very big word!
DGDD318	You're a very bright little man! That's swell! (Hyuk hyuk!)
DGGT319	Laugh while you can.
DGGT320	Soon I will destroy LeChuck and your entire world will lie in ruin.
DGDD321	You bet! Run along and play now, son! (Hyuk!)
DGDD322	Well, that's easy, (hyuk!) matey!
DGDD323	If I can't guess your weight or your age, you get to pick what you want!
DGGT324	What's the catch?
DGDD325	(Hyuk!) There's no catch! It's just that easy!
DGDD326	All righty! (hyuk!) Let Dinghy have a look at you, little guy!
DGDD327	Well let me see here...
DGDD328	I figure a strapping little pirate like you must weigh...oh, ninety-eight pounds?
DGGT329	HA! The joke's on you!
DGGT330	I just LOOK like a little boy! In actuality, I'm a mighty pirate weighing in at...
DGGT331	...ninety-eight pounds.
DGGT332	This is really embarrassing. Am I not eating right? I've been working out.
DGDD333	(Hyuk hyuk!) Bet you I can!
DGDD334	A little fearsome buccaneer like yourself must be... seven years old?
DGGT335	HA! Wrong!
DGGT336	I just so happen to be twenty!
DGDD337	(Hyuk!) Well, do you have any proof for your pal Dinghy Dog?
DGGT338	You calling me a liar?
DGDD339	You bet I am! (Hyuk!)
DGGT340	I have my proof right here.
DGDD341	`SCUMM Actors Guild Membership Card'
DGDD342	`Guybrush Threepwood -- Age: Twenty.`
DGDD343	I suppose you're right! (Hyuk!) Pick your prize!
DGSO344	I really want that talking skull.
DGSO345	One Smuggle Bunny, please.
DGSO346	Give me that anchor!
DGSO347	How about your costume? Can I have that?
DGMR348	Bwahahahaha! With my unfettered demonic might we will RULE THE WORLD!
DGGT349	You're right, Murray. If I had all that power, the temptation for evil would be too great.
DGGT350	I'll take the anchor!
DGDD351	(Hyuk!) Well, what do you know?
DGDD352	Seems your buddy Dinghy Dog forgot to mention something! (Hyuk!)
DGDD353	You have to win more than once to get the prizes from the top shelf!
DGDD354	Would you like to play again?
DGGT355	Uh... okay.
DGDD356	(Hyuk!) All-righty!
DGDD357	I would guess that you are twenty years old.
DGDD358	And that you weigh ninety-eight pounds!
DGGT359	Wait a second! That's not fair!
DGDD360	(Hyuk!) Neither is life, son!
DGDD361	You've learned a valuable lesson today, and that's the best prize of all! (Hyuk hyuk hyuk!)
DGDD362	Choose again!
DGDD363	Take it away, son! Congratulations! (Hyuk!) Enjoy your stay here at Big Whoop!
DGDD364	Nope!
DGDD365	And keep quiet about the costume, son! (Hyuk!)
DGDD366	We don't want to ruin the magic of Big Whoop for the other little boys and girls, now do we?
DGDD367	Oh no you don't, little boy! (Hyuk!)
DGDD368	Just the sight of my manager has caused children older than you to burst into tears!
DGDD369	No can do, son! (Hyuk!)
DGDD370	I'll bet you do! (Hyuk!) It's FUN!
DGDD371	But that ride's only for bigger kids!
DGGT372	I don't care if it's not safe! I have to ride it, now!
DGDD373	Oh no, no, no, son! (Hyuk hyuk!) It's not that it's not safe for little kids to ride...
DGDD374	...it's just that you've gotta be much, much older to really appreciate the sheer mind-numbing terror of the coaster!
DGDD375	But wait a few years, and you'll have matured enough to ride!
DGDD376	You'll also be able to buy candy and eat it whenever and wherever you want, (hyuk!) just like us grownups can!
DGDD377	Uh, nope! (Hyuk!) That ride's only for bigger kids!
DHGT301	I haven't done anything to deserve these.
DHGT302	What's a guy gotta do to get into one of these crypts?
DHGA303	Drop dead.
DHGT304	I just got buried alive, and I was...
DHGA305	I feel I should remind you that as a government employee...
DHGA306	...I cannot be held liable for accidental live burials.
DHGT307	But why was I buried in that particular crypt?
DHGA308	The only other crypt is the Goodsoup Family Crypt.
DHGA309	It's only for the Goodsoup family.
DHGA310	They don't want just any commoner spending eternity with them.
DHGT311	I was wondering...
DHGT312	...isn't there a nicer place to be buried on Blood Island?
DHGA313	Well, there's the Goodsoup family crypt.
DHGA314	That's one fine piece of postmortem real estate. I'll tell you that for free.
DHSO315	Bark!
DHSO316	Woof!
DHSO317	Howwwwwl!
DHSO318	(Pant!)
DHSO319	Arf Arf!
DHGT320	He's just not very social, I guess.
DHGT321	Ow! He bit me!
DHGT322	Okay, fella, this won't hurt a bit.
DHGT323	Hey, I guess it didn't hurt a bit. He must be shedding.
DHPN324	Grrr...
DHNZ325	mallet
DHGT326	It's a big wooden mallet.
DHGT327	I can't use the mallet with that.
DHGT328	I need to use the mallet with something else.
DHGT329	I've got a mallet and a nail... this'll be perfect as soon as I find something to use them with!
DHNZ330	old dog
DHGT331	It's a smelly old dog.
DHGT332	He's not very talkative.
DHGT333	He'd probably like the bone, but I might need it.
DHNZ334	dog bowl
DHNN335	Old Blind Pew
DHGT336	It says, `Old Blind Pew`.
DHGT337	There are some dog treats inside.
DHNZ338	doggy treats
DHGT339	They help fight the buildup of unsightly tartar.
DHGT340	The doggy treats won't do any good with that.
DHNZ341	smelly dog hair
DHGT342	It's a tuft of that old blind dog's hair.
DHGT343	It's the hair of that dog that bit me.
DHGT344	It's every bit as stinky as the rest of this dog.
DHGT345	I can't use the dog hair with that.
DHGT346	I probably need to use the dog hair with something else.
DHGT347	No thanks. I bet it tastes as bad as it smells.
DHGT348	I've avoided dog grooming ever since that tragedy involving my Aunt's poodle.
DHNZ349	chisel
DHGT350	It's the gravedigger's chisel.
DHGT351	I can't use the chisel with that.
DHGT352	It's sharp.
DHGT353	It's already chiseled.
DHNZ354	crack between doors
DHGT355	There's someone in there.
DHGT356	I can't see anyone in there right now.
DHGT357	It's locked tight.
DHGT358	I can't see anyone in there right now.
DHNZ359	skeletal hook
DHGT360	I already have enough skeletal appendages.
DHNZ361	carved tombstone
DHGT362	It's beginning to spell a word.
DHGT363	What could it be?
DHGT364	Rib-roast? Riboflavin?
DHGT365	I don't want to haul that around.
DHGT366	That's not my job.
DHNZ367	assorted coffins
DHGT368	Looks like the gravedigger is a little behind on his burials.
DHNZ369	uncarved tombstones
DHGT370	It's a pile of new tombstones.
DHNZ371	smoldering campfire
DHGT372	Someone should really learn to properly extinguish campfires.
DHGT373	Spitting on the fire won't put it out.
DHGT374	It doesn't look hot enough to melt this block of cheese.
DHNZ375	dog house
DHGT376	How morbid.
DHGT377	I don't think the dog would like that.
DHNZ378	recycling bin
DHGT379	It's a scrap metal recycling bin.
DHNZ380	recycled tools
DHGT381	It's a bunch of old, rusted, gravedigging tools.
DHGT382	Those are too far gone to ever be useful.
DHNZ383	chimney
DHNZ384	lock
DHGT385	That's one big lock.
DHGT386	It's locked.
DHGT387	That lock is way too tough to break, even with a chisel.
DHNZ388	window
DHGT389	I hope the owner of this shack doesn't sleep in that.
DHNZ390	lilies
DHGT391	Lilies...
DHGT392	How cliché.
DHNZ393	workbench
DHGT394	It's a Black Beard's Deck-Maker Workbench.
DHGT395	I always wanted one, but naah.
DHNZ396	chisel
DHNZ397	chisel
DHNZ398	tomb
DHGT399	It says 'Grant's Tomb,'
DHGT400	`It's none of your freaking business who's buried here!`
DHNN401	Grant's Tomb
DHGT402	That's none of my business.
EBPN301	Now we sail back to Blood Island.
EBWM302	Good luck on the rest of your adventures, Guybrush. 
EBGT303	What? You can't mean... 
EBWM304	I'm afraid so. This work is too dangerous for me.
EBWM305	I'm going to find a more stable, secure line of work.
EBWM306	I hear there's still an opening for a chef on Scabb Island.
EBGT307	You'll be sorely missed.
EBWM308	I know. But my destiny lies out there... somewhere... 
EBWM309	...beyond the rolling waves.
EBGT310	Farewell, good friend Welshman!
EBWM311	Oh, wait. Where'd you say Scabb Island was, again?
EBGT312	East by Northeast. You can't miss it.
EBWM313	Uh, thanks a bunch.
EBGT314	Ah! Whoops. I forgot to tell him that a magnetized pin will only have compass-like properties for a short time.
EBGT315	Well, if you insist... 
EBGT316	Hmmm... 
EBGT317	That guy probably couldn't hold his breath underwater for very long.
EBGT318	Too bad.
EBGT319	I hope it was worth it for you.
EBGT320	The tree is empty.
EBGT321	The egg would break when it hit the ground.
EBGT322	Here. Take this compass.
EBWM323	This is a compass? Will it work?
EBGT324	Of course. See how it points North?
EBWM325	Wow! That's incredible! How'd you do that?
EBGT326	Oh, it was nothing.
EBGT327	If you're a ferryman, you must need a compass...
EBWM328	No I don't! I am the Flying Welshman!
EBWM329	One of my other-worldly gifts is a preternatural sense of direction.
EBGT330	Okay, then, I guess I'll just keep it.
EBWM331	Well, I hate to see all your effort, you know, go to waste.
EBGT332	I thought so.
EBNZ333	rubber tree
EBGT334	Wow. I never knew the Caribbean had so many rubber trees.
EBGT335	I can't shake it hard enough with just my hands.
EBNZ336	egg
EBGT337	It's a big egg, sitting precariously at the top of that tree.
EBGT338	It's a big egg.
EBGT339	I can't reach it.
EBGT340	I can't use the egg with that.
EBGT341	I need to use the egg with something else.
EBNZ342	cushion
EBGT343	If I leave it where it is, it'll cushion the egg when it falls.
EBGT344	The cushion is covering a rocky part of the beach.
EBNZ345	mysterious figure
EBGT346	Intimidating.
EBGT347	It's the ferry service to Skull Island.
EBGT348	Not until he gets me to the other side.
EBNZ349	seawater
EBGT350	I really don't want to go in the ocean.
EBGT351	I'm not going down there ever again.
EBGT352	Those advertisements were no lie. It really is crystal clear.
EBNZ353	rocks
EBGT354	It's a rocky part of the beach.
EBGT355	I don't need any rocks.
EBNZ356	weathered sign
EBGT357	`Lost Welshman Ferry Line`
EBGT358	`Haunted sea cruises and whale-watching excursions daily`
EBNZ359	signpost
FCGS301	Oh, dear! He's had a sudden and completely unexpected relapse of death!
FCGS302	Ah, and just as we were getting reacquainted!
FCGS303	As his kinsman, it is my duty to give him a proper burial!
FCGS304	It is my solemn vow...
FCGS305	...young Hearty Beef N. Potato... 
FCGS306	...my dear Vegetable Goodsoup... 
FCGS307	...the youthful P. Hamilton Goodsoup... 
FCGS308	...the late, lamented Wonton Goodsoup... 
FCGS309	...that this anonymous pirate-in-training... 
FCGS310	...shall be buried in the Goodsoup family crypt!
FCGT311	All right!
FCGS312	Dead again! Oh, for pity's sake!
FCGS313	Not again!
FCGS314	I just can't afford any more of these funerals.
FCGS315	Maybe I won't rent the WHOLE orchestra this time.
FCGS316	I hope he stays dead this time.
FCGB317	Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in. I was just...
FCGB318	Charles? Charles DeGoulash? Is it really you?
FCGG319	Minnie! It's been so long!
FCGB320	Oh Charles, it has! It has!
FCGB321	You look so different?
FCGG322	Really? Why, you look exactly the same.
FCGB323	Oh, Charles. How you flatter me.
FCGB324	Oh, but you MUST go now.
FCGG325	But why, now that I've found you again after all these years?
FCGB326	What would our families say if they knew we were alone together on such a romantic night?
FCGG327	Minnie, this may sound rash, but I...
FCGG328	I LOVE you, Minnie Goodsoup!
FCGB329	Oh, Charles you mustn't!
FCGG330	Oh, I can't help it!
FCGG331	I've always loved ya! Do you hear! I've always loved ya Minnie and I always will!
FCGG332	Come away with me now!
FCGB333	Elope? Oh, but Charles! It just isn't done! Think of the scandal it would cause!
FCGG334	To HECK with the scandal, Minnie!
FCGB335	Oooooh!
FCGG336	Marry me!
FCGB337	Oh, yes Charles! Yes! A thousand times YES!
FCGG338	Then kiss me, my love!
FCGT339	Hey!
FCGT340	There's a hole in the ceiling of this crypt!
FCGT341	I think I might be able to squeeze through!
FCNZ342	door
FCGT343	It's locked. There's no way out!
FCGT344	It goes out to the cemetery.
FCGT345	Even with this crowbar I wouldn't be strong enough to pry this thick gate open.
FCGT346	This chisel is too small to work on these bars.
FCNZ347	engagement band
FCGT348	It looks like it's just about Elaine's size.
FCGT349	But it needs a diamond to be complete.
FCGT350	That's not my bride-to-be.
FCGT351	I'm not ready to make a commitment to that.
FCGT352	I don't think the engagement band would fit me.
FCNZ353	coffin
FCGT354	Ominous.
FCGT355	I had a hard enough time getting out of it.
FCNZ356	crumbling hole
FCNZ357	ghost bride
FCGT358	It's a ghost in a bride's gown.
FCGT359	She looks very sad and lonely.
FCNZ360	coffin
FCGT361	Morbid.
FCNZ362	memorial wreath
FCGT363	Tastefully done.
FCNZ364	plaque
FCGT365	It's a memorial plaque for Minnie `Stronie` Goodsoup.
F2GT301	Who are you?
F2WM302	I...I am the LOST WELSHMAN!
F2GT303	Ooooh.
F2WM304	I am the ferryman between here and Skull Island...
F2WM305	...trapped for so very long in the icy ocean mists.
F2WM306	Oh, how I hate that blasted mist.
F2GT307	Really? I like mist. I think it's pretty.
F2WM308	Well, SURE mist is pretty!
F2WM309	But EGAD is it dull.
F2NN310	Lost Welshman
F2SO311	I'd like a ride out to Skull Island, please.
F2SO312	Never mind.
F2WM313	I will never again dare that wretched fog without a compass.
F2WM314	Once too often did I tempt fate...
F2WM315	...and just look what it did to my clothes.
F2WM316	Just look at me! I'm soaked!
F2GT317	Well, you know, I just happen to have a compass right here.
F2WM318	Then, poor mortal, I will show you the way.
F2WM319	Rough seas and untold dangers await you on the mysterious Skull Island.
F2GT320	I'm not afraid!
F2WM321	You will be.
F2WM322	You WILL be.
F2WM323	I will risk these rough waters no more!
F2WM324	For too long have I rocked in that watery cradle of death.
F2GT325	Freaky imagery.
F2WM326	Whatever. Anyway, I'm not going out there again......until I'm sure I can make it there safely. 
F2WM327	I need a compass.
F2GT328	How will being able to draw perfect circles get you out to Skull Island?
F2WM329	Not that kind of compass. The directional kind.
F2WM330	I told you, not until I get a compass.
F2WM331	If you find me one, I'll take you to Skull Island.
F2WM332	All right, let's go.
FFGT301	There's something big, shiny, and CURSED keeping me from putting on this ring... 
FFGT302	It's empty.
FFGT303	I've already got all the fireflies I need.
FFGT304	If only it were that easy.
FFGT305	Let's see if this slippery greasy lotion does the trick.
FFGT306	That should do it.
FFPN307	POW!
FFGT308	The cursed ring exploded!
FFNN309	Elaine's left ring finger
FFGT310	That ring is really stuck on her finger.
FFGT311	They're trapped inside and glowing like mad!
FFNN312	lantern

FFNN315	empty jar

FFNN317	Elaine
FFNN318	Elaine's left ring finger
FFNN319	dead fireflies
FFNZ320	stump
FFGT321	Hey, a stump!
FFGT322	Putting an EMPTY jar on that stump won't do anything.
FFGT323	The sugar water would attract the fireflies, but there's no way I could catch them.
FFGT324	Putting an empty measuring cup there won't do anything.
FFNZ325	Elaine
FFGT326	No offense, Elaine, but you are WAY too heavy for me to haul you around.
FFGT327	I don't think she can hear me.
FFGT328	It doesn't look like she's hurt... 
FFGT329	...well, except for that whole turned-to-gold-by-a-pirate-curse thing.
FFNZ330	jar
FFGT331	It's full of fireflies.
FFGT332	It's full of yummy, delicious sugar water!
FFGT333	Mmmm... bet that water sure tastes good!
FFGT334	Glow, tiny friends! Glow!
FFGT335	I haven't chugged a jarful of dead fireflies since college.
FFGT336	I'm not really in the mood for a jarful of half-fermented sugar water.
FFGT337	The fireflies will escape!
FFGT338	I don't want to close it yet.
FFNZ339	cursed diamond ring
FFGT340	It's Elaine's finger, ready for a new ring.
FFGT341	It's that accursed cursed ring.
FFGT342	I don't think Elaine would be satisfied with just a gold band.
FFGT343	Elaine can't wear this diamond unless it's in a setting.
FFGT344	There's enough lotion on there already.
FFGT345	Licking her finger won't loosen the ring enough.
FFGT346	Don't you think that is just a TAD drastic?
FFGT347	This stuff just isn't slippery enough to do the trick.
FFNZ349	fireflies
FFGT350	They sure are bright.
FFGT351	They're too small and fast for me to catch with my hands.
FFGT352	They won't fly into the jar for no reason.
FBGT301	Oh no!
FBGT302	Elaine!
FBGT303	She's not going to be happy about this.
FBGT304	Elaine?
FBGT305	Honey?
FBGT306	You okay?
FBGT307	Can I get you anything?
FBGT308	I'll just start lifting that pirate curse, then, huh?
FBGT309	She must weigh a ton!
FBGT310	Uh, no offense.
FBGT311	Hmmm, I wonder how many karats she...
FBGT312	No, no. Bad idea.
FBGT313	Tastes like... sand...
FBGT314	That's my first clue!
FBNZ315	Elaine
FBGT316	It's Elaine. I've got to change her back somehow!
FBNZ317	handprints
FBGT318	There are handprints leading to where Elaine was standing... 
FBGT319	...she's been abducted by some fiendish acrobatic troupe!
FBGT320	That whole monkey-pirate thing is just bizarre.
FBGT321	Those pirates in Danjer Cove walk on their hands? Weird!
FBGT322	They're still warm!
FBNZ324	fort
FBGT325	That fort has seen better days.
FBNZ326	bridge
FBGT327	The bridge is uncrossable.
FBGT328	It's just as well. There's nothing interesting in the fort anyway.
FBNZ329	welcome sign
FBGT330	It says, `Welcome to Puerto Pollo, from the Plunder Island Poultry Brotherhood.`

F1FS301	Fifteen men on a dead man's... huh?
F1FS302	Who are you?
F1SO303	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pirate!
F1SO304	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I want my girlfriend!
F1SO305	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I mean to kill you all!
F1SO306	Uh, Ensign Guybrush Threepwood, reporting for duty, sir.
F1FS307	Well, we'll just see how your threats sit with my captain.
F1FS308	Huh. Hmmm. You don't look like a member of my crew.
F1GT309	Honest! I'm the new guy.
F1FS310	I haven't heard of any new recruits. I'll have to check that out with my captain.
F1GT311	Your captain?
F1FS312	Yes, Threepwood. You've come aboard The Sea Cucumber.
F1FS313	I am Mr. Fossey, heh, the First Mate.
F1FS314	And my captain? Why, he's the scourge of the Seven Seas!
F1FS315	The most fearsome pirate in all the Caribbean!
F1FS316	The dread pirate LeCh...
F1GT317	LeCh...!
F1FS318	That's right! Captain LeCh...
F1FS319	Yes, Cap'n?
F1FS320	Just an intruder, sir. But I'm dealing with him.
F1FS321	Oh, yes sir! Right away.  Will do.
F1FS322	He says you're to be tortured. Choose your punishment... 
F1FS323	...You can either be tarred and feathered... 
F1FS324	...Or you can walk the plank.
F1SO325	Oh, I walked that plank thing on the way up. Good enough?
F1SO326	Couldn't you just let me off with a stern warning?
F1SO327	Feathered sounds good. How about just feathered?
F1SO328	Any tortures not involving pain, humiliation or stickiness?
F1FS329	No, sorry.
F1FS330	Oh, what to do...what to do...
F1FS331	Well, I suppose we'll have to go with walking the plank.
F1FS332	We're trying to avoid using the tar and feathers.
F1FS333	It's messy, and we need to save the tar for emergency leak repair.
F1FS334	What do you say men! Shall we make him walk the plank?
F1FS336	To the plank with ye!
F1FS337	Hmm. What's that, cap'n?
F1FS338	Vandals?!?
F1FS339	Well, looks like we're having technical difficulties, Threepwood... 
F1FS340	...so we'll have to drag out the tar and feathers after all.
F1FS341	You again!
F1FS342	I don't know how or why you came back on board...
F1FS343	...but you'll be sorry you did!
F1FS344	AGAIN with the sneaking on board the ship!
F1FS345	I don't know how or why you came back on board... 
F1FS346	...but the next time you walk the plank will be your last!
F1FS347	What's that, cap'n?
F1FS348	Vandals?!?
F1FS349	Well, Threepwood. Looks like we're having a bit of technical difficulties, here, so... 
F1FS350	...our illustrious captain LeCh... 
F1FS351	Yes sir, tar and feathers.
F1FS352	I know it's messy, but it's the only torture we have left!
F1FS353	Hmmm. Well, what shall I do with him, Captain?
F1FS354	O.K.
F1FS355	Our illustrious captain has declared that you shall be tarred and feathered!
GDGT301	Thanks guys.
GDGT302	You were a world of help back there.
GDBL303	It was a rousing battle, Cap'n!
GDHM304	Aye, and it reminds me of a song...
GDGT305	We lost a sea battle!
GDGT306	How humiliating for a pirate of my skill and experience.
GDGT307	We lost again!
GDGT308	What am I doing wrong?
GDGT309	That ship was WAY too powerful...
GDGT310	I should be fighting less fearsome opponents...
GDGT311	That was a pretty even match up...
GDGT312	I SHOULD be able to beat that ship!...
GDGT313	Darn!
GDGT314	This just keeps getting harder...
GDGT315	This really stinks!
GDGT316	If only I could win just once...
GDGT317	That was an even match-up...
GDGT318	I SHOULD be able to beat that ship...
GDGT319	I'm still going after ships that are too big for me...
GDGT320	I'll never get any gold if I don't go after lesser pirates than that...
GDGT321	Maybe I can use some of that gold I have to upgrade the ship...
GDGT322	I've just got to keep trying...
GDGT323	Maybe I can get just a little treasure and upgrade the ship...
GDGT324	That was an even match-up...
GDGT325	I SHOULD be able to beat that ship...
GDGT326	I'm still going after ships that are too big for me...
GDGT327	I'll never get any gold if I don't go after lesser pirates than that...
GDGT328	I really shouldn't pick on those poor, defenseless tourists.
GDGT329	It's not good for business on the island.
GDGT330	They do make for good cannon fodder, though...
GDGT331	I guess I need more practice with this swordfighting stuff.
GDGT332	At least I showed 'em in the high-seas-combat part...
GDGT333	We're loaded with booty!
GDGT334	That's one weak looking cannon.
GDGT335	The `Buccaneer's Buddy!` It's kind of pathetic.
GDGT336	The `Ouch-Master!` Not a bad little cannon.
GDGT337	The `Holemaker Deluxe!` A sporty model with good stopping power.
GDGT338	The `Paingiver 2000!` That's a powerful cannon.
GDGT339	The `Mr. Massacre!' cannon.
GDGT340	It's the `Destructomatic T-47 armor-piercing Carnage Delivery System with auto-loading and fax-modem!`
GDVH341	Whooo hooo hooo!
GDGT342	Uhhh... Haggis?
GDHM343	Yes?
GDSO344	I think I'd like full tactical control, now.
GDSO345	I'm ready to take full control this time.
GDSO346	Could you guys give me a hand with this ship combat stuff?
GDSO347	I need a hand here, again.
GDSO348	What am I doing here?
GDSO349	Never mind.
GDHM350	All right, laddy...
GDHM351	We'll give ya a chance.
GDHM352	We'll give ya another chance.
GDHM353	Hard ship combat it is.
GDHM354	I just hope ya know what yer doin'...
GDHM355	Oh, no laddy!
GDHM356	Wouldn't dream of it!
GDGT357	But...
GDHM358	You wanted to do it on your own!
GDGT359	Oh, Haggis...
GDHM360	Don't 'Oh, Haggis' me! We offered our help and you didn't want it!
GDGT361	Don't be THAT way Haggis.
GDGT362	Help me out just this once and I'll fix you up with my sister.
GDHM363	Not interested.
GDSO364	She's beautiful.
GDSO365	She's rich.
GDSO366	She has a full head of hair.
GDHM367	So's me pride!
GDHM368	Rich?
GDHM369	How rich?
GDGT370	Did I mention she has a great personality?
GDHM371	Is it her own hair?
GDGT372	Did I mention she's good with children and animals.
GDHM373	Well now, Captain...let's not take it so personal.
GDHM374	All right, laddy...
GDHM375	I guess we're all in the same boat...
GDHM376	...and unless we help you out we'll never make it to Blood Island.
GDHM377	Easy ship combat it is!
GDHM378	Well, Captain Threepwood...
GDHM379	If ye e'er be hopin' ta defeat this scalawag Rottingham ship ta ship...
GDHM380	...we'll be needin' some bigger cannon.
GDHM381	So, lad. I say we tackle some of the wee pirates that prowl these waters.
GDHM382	We'll seize their treasure and use it to buy new weaponry back at Puerto Pollo.
GDHM383	Well, lad. We'll be needin' ta capture the treasure o' some a the more pathetic pirates sailing through these parts.
GDHM384	Then we'll use their treasure ta buy bigger cannons for our ship.
GDHM385	Aye!
GDNZ386	treasure hold
GDGT387	Look at all that booty!
GDGT388	It's empty.
GDGT389	It's so full I couldn't even walk down there.
GDGT390	It's all wet and creepy in there.
GDNZ391	navigational chart
GDGT392	I'm afraid of getting lead poisoning from the ink.
GDGT393	No, I'm terrible at folding up maps.

GRGT301	It's already open.
GRGT302	There. The bed has been nailed down.
GRGT303	I'm not sure if that's strong enough to hold it.
GRGT304	I might need one more nail.
GRGT305	That ought to do it.
GRGT306	I can't pull it down. I think I broke it.
GRNZ307	bed
GRGT308	It's a Murphy bed.
GRGT309	I need to pull down the bed first.
GRNZ310	bed
GRGT311	Looks comfortable.
GRGT312	One nail will never be enough to hold down this bed.
GRGT313	Not enough leverage.

GRGT315	`The Goodsoups: A Life in Pictures by M.M. Goodsoup`
GRNN316	Goodsoup family history

GRGT318	It's full of all the dates and fun facts you'd ever want to know about the Goodsoup family.
GRGT319	And it says I'll receive a new book every month or cancel with no obligation...
GRGT320	...and keep my copy of `Buccaneers and Bouillabaisse` as a free gift.
GRGT321	The bed slammed up before I could take it.
GRGT322	I can't use the book with that.

GRGT324	Wow. I bet his room charges are pretty hefty by now.
GRGT325	The bad slammed up before I could reach him.
GRGT326	Eww. Gross.
GRGT327	I wouldn't know what to say.
GRNZ328	boarded hole
GRGT329	Those nails are in there tough.
GRGT330	The Murphy bed has slammed up so many times it's made a hole in the wall.
GRGT331	I can see the Goodsoup crypt from here.
GRGT332	The bed slammed up before I could get to it.
GRNN333	gaping hole
GRGT334	This won't give me enough leverage to pry those boards off.

GRGT336	It looks out over the cemetery. Creepy.
GRGT337	It won't open.
GRGT338	I don't want to break the window.

GRGT343	They must leave a mint on his pillow every night.
GRGT344	Good thing, too or he'd really stink by now.
GRGT345	It's an enormous pile of grog-o-mints, courtesy of this establishment.
GRGT346	The bed slammed up before I could reach them.
GRGT347	I don't make a habit of eating things found next to corpses.

GRGT349	Quaint.
GRGT350	I'm sure there's nothing in there except one of those hotel bibles.

GLGT301	Hey Murray, remember this?
GLMR302	I'd still appreciate it if I could have that back.
GLGT303	What would you do with it without your collarbone?
GLMR304	Oh, never mind...
GLGT305	Hey, Murray...
GLMR306	Stop tormenting me!
GLGT307	Hey, Murray, check this out!
GLMR308	Oh, ick.
GLMR309	What have you done to my arm?

GLGT316	What a completely random piece of trivia.
GLGT317	It's made from... porcelain!
GLGT318	Uhhh... porcelain!
GLGT319	More porcelain! When will this nightmare end?
GLGT320	Ahh! I HATE porcelain!
GLGT321	It's a long story. I'll explain later.

GOGT309	Wait! I can remember!
GOGT310	I've seen this place before...in some terrible nightmare!
GOLC311	'Twas no mere nightmare, Guybrush! Search yer feelings! Ye know it to be true!
GOGT312	OH NO! IT CAN'T BE! BUT IT IS!
GOGT313	This is the Carnival of the Damned!

GOLC320	Ahhh! But this be a very special treasure! This be the fabled treasure of Big Whoop!
GOGT321	Big Whoop!
GOLC322	Aye! The very pirate treasure you were searching for before I caught up with ye!
GOLC323	Very well, Threepwood.
GOLC324	If you're going to act like a child, I'll help get you in the mood.
GOLC325	I think you deserve a time-out, young man!

GOLC331	Oh, don't mourn for him, my love.
GOLC332	I'm not ready to do away with Guybrush permanently yet.
GOLC333	He has been far too much of an annoyance to kill him so quickly.

GOGT354	It's the solid steel, six-inch-thick door to this insidious cage!
GVGT301	Hey! Mister! Help!
GVGA302	What? Who's there? Who said that?
GVGA303	Who's scarin' poor old Mort the gravedigger?
GVGT304	There's been a horrifying mistake! I've been buried alive in the Goodsoup family crypt!
GVGA305	All right! This joke has gone far enough! You kids should be ashamed of yourselves!
GVGT306	It's no joke! I'm really trapped in here!
GVGA307	Crazy kids with your long hair and your Baroque music...
GVGA308	...fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
GVGT309	It's me again, the guy who isn't trapped in the Goodsoup family crypt.
GVGA310	Whaddya want?
GVSO311	This isn't a trick! I'm REALLY trapped in this crypt!
GVSO312	Just come and look at me through this crack.
GVSO313	Curses! You've seen through my web of deceit!
GVSO314	Bwahahahaha! Fear me! I'm an evil ghost!
GVSO315	I'm going to haunt you until you set me free.
GVSO316	Could my shadow be on your wall if I wasn't in the crypt?
GVSO317	You must love horror stories to own all these collectibles.
GVSO318	Why are you wasting your money on all this bad fiction?
GVSO319	LET ME OUT OF THIS CRYPT!
GVSO320	I'm going to go sulk in the darkness now.
GVGT321	I'm no ordinary man trapped in a crypt!
GVGA322	Well, what are you then?
GVGA323	Have a good time.
GVGA324	I'm not falling for your tricks THIS time!
GVGA325	Just leave me alone and let me read my horror novels!
GVGA326	At least MY bad fiction doesn't require over a thousand dollars in hardware!
GVGT327	I see your point.
GVGA328	Reading fantastic stories about the dead helps me keep my mind off my work.
GVGA329	There is such a thing as being too absorbed with your own occupation.
GVGT330	Don't you believe it.
GVGT331	Actually, I'm a ghost trapped in this crypt.
GVGT332	What I meant to say was...
GVSO333	My faster than light ship is trapped in a subspace anomaly!
GVSO334	I seek the Golden Rods of C'thon to bring peace to the shire!
GVSO335	I'm an angry and deranged ghost haunting this crypt!
GVSO336	I'm selling these fine leather jackets.
GVGA337	You have no ship!
GVGA338	Any true warp traveler would know that reversing the polarity of the ion flux field...
GVGA339	...would result in a tachyon expansion wave, creating a trail of neutrinos that could be followed out of the anomaly.
GVGA340	Do you bear the mark of Tx'Plc'k, the chosen one foretold by the Scrolls of the Third Shadow?
GVGT341	I was hoping you wouldn't ask.
GVGA342	I'm a vegan. I HATE the exploitation of animals.
GVGT343	Really? But what about all those stuffed heads on your wall?
GVGA344	Only one of those is real.
GVGA345	Oh, SURE! I turn my back to the door, and you thieving little hoodlums...
GVGA346	...will sneak up from behind and tie me up!
GVGA347	I read all about your sinister ways in my horror novels!
GVGA348	So, nothin' doin'!
GVGA349	No way, buster!
GVGA350	Then let me see you appear before me!
GVGT351	Excuse me?
GVGA352	If you were a REAL spirit you could materialize in a ghostly form. It's ALL in the books.
GVGA353	Well...let's see it!
GVGT354	Isn't the ominous sound of my disembodied voice proof enough?
GVGT355	I guess not.
GVGA356	Then go ahead. Show your ghastly visage.
GVGT357	I can't. I'm shy.
GVGT358	Not right now.
GVGA359	You're no ghost!
GVGA360	So you say you're a ghost?
GVGT361	Sure I am! Can't you see my ghostly form on the wall behind you?
GVGA362	That! Ha-Ha! That's not the form of a vicious, tortured spirit from beyond the grave!
GVGA363	Now there's a picture of a ghost in my copy of `Masque of the Red Mud.`
GVGA364	Huge, hollow eyes! Toothy, remorseless grin! Glowing inner fire!
GVGA365	That's what a ghost looks like!
GVGA366	You've got the silhouette of a doofy, pencil-necked boy!
GVGA367	Ha! If you were a ghost, you would cast a scarier shadow!
GVGT368	I drank a special potion that put me into a coma.
GVGT369	Thinking I was dead, they buried me in this crypt.
GVGA370	Yeah! RIGHT!
GVGA371	They did that in the book `Never Trade Lunches with a Corpse.`
GVGA372	If you kids ever came up with an original idea, I might believe you.
GVGA373	You can't fool me with that old shadow trick!
GVGA374	I read all about it in `The Spork of Madness.`
GVGA375	Young ruffians use a false shadow on the wall to lure an old man out of his home so they can rob him.
GVGA376	You must've read the same book! Well, I'm on to your wily tricks! So SCAT!
HGGT301	Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, here to serve all your mighty pirate needs.
HGHM302	Pleasure to meet ye, Guybrush. I am Haggis McMutton, of the clan McMutton.

HGSO304	I sure could use a haircut.
HGSO305	I'd like to finish that haircut.
HGSO306	I think that's enough of a haircut for now.
HGSO307	How did you become a barber pirate?
HGSO308	Do you know any rousing pirate stories?
HGSO309	So what happened on Bulky Island?
HGSO310	What finally happened to the treasure on Bulky Island?
HGSO311	How would you like to join my crew?
HGSO312	Are you sure you don't want to join my crew?
HGSO313	Are you ready to set sail for adventure?
HGSO314	`Haggis.` That's an unusual name.
HGSO315	What is that blue stuff in the jar, anyway?
HGSO316	Those sure are nice scissors.
HGSO317	Could I borrow those scissors for a minute?
HGSO318	When I think of all I could do with those scissors...
HGSO319	Did I mention how nice those scissors are?
HGSO320	Please let me borrow those scissors.
HGSO321	Never mind.
HGHM322	Aye. I'll be on board your ship when you're ready for me.
HGHM323	Ah! The ol' comb juice!
HGHM324	'Tis a fiery brew that's bested many a sailor with her fermented froth.
HGHM325	It'll burn your throat, unless you chase it with conditioner.
HGHM326	I spent ten years at sea on board the H.M.S. Anathema, the fastest ship in the Scottish Navy.
HGGT327	So how did that help you become a barber pirate?
HGHM328	It was a clipper ship.
HGGT329	Ah.
HGSO330	Do you know any rousing pirate stories?
HGSO331	So you started this salon?
HGSO332	I want to know more about safe hair replacement systems.
HGSO333	That's interesting. I've got to go.
HGHM334	Aye, but not on me own.
HGHM335	I grew to love hairstyling so much that I told two of me best friends about it.
HGGT336	And then they told two friends...
HGHM337	Aye, and they told two friends, and so on, and so on.
HGHM338	Ach! There's no such thing!
HGHM339	It's nae proper to fool with the course of nature!
HGHM340	Well, there is the story of The Secret of Bulky Island.
HGHM341	We were a crew of two score men under the command of Big Jake McJuggernaut, the most powerful captain on the seas.
HGHM342	One night in port, Cap'n Jake heard a tale of an enormous treasure buried somewhere on Bulky Island.
HGHM343	We set sail and landed on the island within a fortnight, and found the treasure the next morning.
HGSO344	Bulky Island? Where's that?
HGSO345	How big a treasure are we talking about here?
HGSO346	Is this going to be scary?
HGSO347	Okay, I changed my mind. I don't want to hear this.
HGHM348	Ye won't find it on any map; Cap'n Jake took the location of the treasure to his grave.
HGHM349	Immense. An inconceivable amount of gold, silver, jewels, and coupons for discounts at area restaurants.
HGGT350	Because I warn you, I tend to sweat profusely when frightened, and there's a lot of places I still have to go today.
HGHM351	I'll edit out the scary parts.
HGHM352	Oh, it was a beautiful sight. A tremendous chest made of solid gold.
HGHM353	Big Jake leapt into the hole and wrapped his sinewy arms around the chest.
HGHM354	He gathered his resolve, counted to three, filled his lungs, and lifted with all his might.
HGHM355	The sound of his back cracking brought a grimace to even the most steel-hearted crewman.
HGHM356	By nightfall the lot of us were lying on the beach, writhing in pain.
HGSO357	Why didn't you lift with your knees?
HGSO358	Why didn't you work in pairs or groups of three or four?
HGSO359	Why didn't you set up a system of ropes and pulleys?
HGSO360	Why didn't you flood the hole and let the chest float out?
HGSO361	What a depressing story. I don't want to hear any more.
HGHM362	That would've been the weak man's way out!
HGHM363	The pirate Angus McFulcrum had followed us to Bulky Island, wantin' the treasure for himself.
HGHM364	The weakling used a lever and took the chest, laughing at us as he carried it to his ship.
HGHM365	And my proud Cap'n McJuggernaut died in traction, cursing himself for not being strong enough.
HGHM366	Ye seem like a nice enough sort, Guybrush, but a man canna serve as my captain unless he earns me respect.
HGGT367	And how would a man go about doing that?
HGHM368	By besting me in a time-honored test o' strength.
HGSO369	Wrist wrestling?
HGSO370	Australian rules football?
HGSO371	The 500-meter bucket-full-of-heavy-rocks relay?
HGSO372	Helping you move?
HGSO373	An in-your-face, no-holds-barred cage match to the death?
HGSO374	How about a test of who can hold his breath the longest?
HGHM375	Oh, could ye? I just have a bed and a few boxes of books...
HGGT376	I was just kidding. Was that really the test of strength?
HGHM377	No, I'm talkin' about the traditional Highlander display of strength and virility...
HGHM378	...the caber toss!
HGSO379	What in the world is a caber?
HGSO380	Is this some sort of weird hazing ritual?
HGSO381	Oh, but in school I was always picked last for caber tossing.
HGSO382	Could you explain this caber-tossing concept again?
HGSO383	Sounds great! Let's do it!
HGSO384	Ahhh, toss THIS.
HGHM385	No, no, nothing like that.
HGHM386	Perhaps after I finish with your hair.
HGHM387	Maybe it's because ye weren't familiar enough with the sport.
HGHM388	Ye see...
HGHM389	The caber is a large tree trunk.
HGHM390	We go to the field of competition and each of us heaves the caber as far as he can.
HGHM391	The man whose caber goes the farthest is the winner.
HGGT392	That's just about the stupidest sport I've ever heard of. And I watch cable television.
HGHM393	Aye, but ye cannot argue with tradition.
HGHM394	It's as I told ye, Guybrush. Not until you can best me in the caber toss.
HGHM395	I'm sorry. I can't discuss business matters without both me partners bein' present.
HGHM396	I suppose it is, but `Haggis` is just a nickname.
HGHM397	Me given name is Heart Liver and Kidneys Boiled in the Stomach of the Animal McMutton.
HGGT398	Oh, so your parents were expecting a girl.
HGHM399	Aye.
HGHM400	Aye, they're me best pair. They can cut through almost anything.
HGGT401	Why are they in the ceiling?
HGHM402	Sometimes, I cut hair so fast the scissors fly from me hands at unbelievable speeds.
HGHM403	Sorry, no. They're much too valuable to me.
HGHM404	You know they can cut through almost anything.
HGGT405	Yes, I believe you mentioned that.
HGHM406	Aye.
HGHM407	The scissors are just that good.
HGHM408	Ye did, and it's all true. They're the best pair I've ever owned.
HGGT409	And they can cut through anything.
HGHM410	Sorry, but no.
HGHM411	Aye, as you say, laddie.
HDGT301	Shoot. This is going to be difficult.
HDGT302	Stupid knot.
HDGT303	I don't see why they had to tie it so tight.
HDNZ304	platform
HDNZ305	fallen rope
HDGT306	It's a sturdy piece of rope.
HDGT307	It's a piece of rope soaked in lamp oil.
HDGT308	I can't use the rope with that.
HDGT309	I can't use the oily rope with that.
HDGT310	Neat. Rope.
HDGT311	It's soaked with oil.
HDGT312	There. It's soaked in oil and probably highly flammable.

HDGT317	Now THAT is a well-tied knot.

HDGT323	I can't reach it up there.

HDGT326	It's a mechanical Herman Toothrot.
HDGT327	This one doesn't talk. Thank you, technology!

HDGT329	I had a feeling he'd turn up sooner or later.

HDGT331	It's a diorama depicting Monkey Island as it appeared when I first arrived there.
HXGT301	I guess I'll just drag this down to Haggis now.
HXGT302	Here, Haggis.
HXGT303	This stuff should work to patch up the ship.
HXHM304	Aye, laddy...Indeed it should!
HXHM305	The consistency of tar...but with a tangy pepper taste!
HXGT306	So, can I have your lotion now?
HXHM307	Aye, lad! Go ahead and take it.
HXGT308	I'll just use some of the cheese here.

HXNZ313	barbecue
HXGT314	The lava has really heated up the barbecue.
HXGT315	This barbecue is too cold to cook anything.
HXGT316	I'd probably burn my hand pretty badly if I touch it now.
HXGT317	I can't lift a stone barbecue!
HXGT318	Licking the barbecue is not my idea of a good time.
HXNZ319	cooking pot
HXGT320	That melted cheese looks just like yellow tar.
HXGT321	It's a big, cast-iron pot with a hunk of cheese inside.
HXGT322	It's a big, heavy-looking cast-iron cooking pot.
HXGT323	Come to think of it, I don't want any fresh nacho cheese.
HXGT324	I wouldn't eat that cheese before, and the fact that it's in an old kettle doesn't change that.
HXGT325	We all need more iron in our diet, but not like this.
HXGT326	There's already enough cheese in the pot.
HXGT327	I'm not going to carry around that heavy iron pot for no reason.
HXGT328	I don't want to cook the paste.
HXGT329	I don't want to cook the cushion.
HXGT330	I don't want to cook the hangover cure.
HXGT331	I don't want to make a stew.
HXGT332	I don't want to cook the tofu.
HXNZ333	un-melted hunk of nacho cheese
HXGT334	I don't want to use the cheese with that.
HXGT335	I already have the cheese.

HBGT305	Cool! You're a fortune-teller!

HBGT309	'If you're a pirate with a sturdy skeletal structure and a high threshold for pain...'
HBGT310	...but 'high threshold for pain' is crossed out and replaced with 'craving for adventure'...
HBGT311	'Then Big Whoop is the place for you! Visit Big Whoop! Do it right now!'
HBGT312	There's no pictures or maps or anything. It just says that it's an awful lot of fun, honest.
HBGT313	'Visit Big Whoop! Do it right now!' But there's no maps or pictures.
HBGT314	It's full of glowing fireflies.
HBGT315	Oh, no! All the fireflies have suffocated!
HBGT316	It's a bunch of dead fireflies, floating in some sugar-water.
HBGT317	It's full of sugar water.
HBGT318	It says `We Welcome Your TIPS!`
HBGT319	It's empty.
HBGT320	Hi guys! I guess you'll be wondering how I came to be back from the dead.
HBGT321	No questions for the dead guy come back to life?
HBGT322	No questions like: `Is there life after death?` or `Is there a heaven?`
HBGT323	`Will there be adequate parking?`
HBGT324	Fine! Be that way! I wouldn't tell you about the hereafter if you BEGGED me!
HBGT325	Hey! What an amazing story I have to tell! I was dead, but I live again!
HBGT326	Who wants to hear about it?
HBGT327	You guys don't deserve to hear a good story!
HBGT328	Hi guys! I've risen from the deepest recesses of the underworld!
HBGT329	Your curiosity is overwhelming.
HBGT330	It's me again. Was dead. Alive now.
HBGT331	Ouch.
HBGT332	That stuff is awful.
HBGT333	Here's your glass back.
HBGT334	Can I have some fresh nachos?
HBGS335	You could... 
HBGS336	...except that the nacho maker has been broken for years.
HBGS337	I would have gotten rid of the darn thing long ago, but I can't budge it.
HBGS338	That congealed nacho cheese is tougher than pitch.
HBGS339	It seeped through the broken glass and glued the machine to the bar.
HBGT340	I still can't have any nachos?
HBGS341	The machine is broken and that nacho cheese has glued it to the bar.
HBGT342	Thanks anyway.
HBGS343	Well, son, it looks like you were right.
HBGS344	Welcome back to the glorious name of Goodsoup!
HBGT345	I'm, uh, honored.
HBGS346	And as a Goodsoup, you're welcome to every benefit the name provides... 
HBGS347	...instant prestige around Blood Island... 
HBGS348	...a ten-percent discount in any of the Goodsoup resorts in the Caribbean... 
HBGS349	...and, of course, medical, dental, and a 401K.
HBGS350	And the best thing of all... 
HBGS351	...if you should happen to drop dead, you will be buried in the extravagant Goodsoup family crypt!
HBGT352	It's as if all my dreams have come true.
HBGT353	Here's some hair of the dog.
HBGS354	Did he bite you?
HBGT355	Well... not really, no.
HBGS356	Then it doesn't do me much good, does it?
HBGS357	Oh, is my head ever ringing.
HBGT358	Boy, do you look terrible!
HBGS359	Stop shouting!
HBGS360	What is that?
HBGT361	I found this egg for your hangover remedy!
HBGT362	I found this egg.
HBGT363	Here's a wild pepper for your hangover remedy!
HBGT364	I found this wild pepper.
HBGT365	This is some of the hair of the dog that bit me!
HBGT366	That smelly old dog bit me and left me with a handful of his hair!
HBGS367	Shhhh! Thanks.
HBGS368	Ah, that'll be perfect for my hangover remedy.
HBGS369	That's all the ingredients I need.
HBGS370	Let me quietly mix up a dose... 
HBGS371	Ah, much better. Here, you can take the rest.
HBGT372	It just occurred to me that mixing medicine and alcohol is a really stupid and possibly lethal thing to do.
HBGT373	If I were a real person instead of a loveably inept cartoon character with the potential for a few more sequels...
HBGT374	...I wouldn't even consider it.
HBGT375	Skoal!
HBGT376	That's odd. It's supposed to cause drowsiness.
HBGT377	I don't feel the least bit drowsy.
HBGT378	In fact, I...
HBGT379	...in fact I feel...
HBGT380	...I feel...

HBGS382	Here!
HBGS383	Did you just take my mirror?
HBGT384	No.
HBGS385	You're lying, aren't you?
HBGT386	Yes.
HBGT387	Sheesh, what a grouch.
HBGS388	What was that?
HBGT389	Nothing.
HBNN390	mirror
HBGS391	You just stole that mirror, didn't you?
HBGT392	No, I didn't! It's right there! Look!
HBGS393	Hmm. I guess you're right.
HBGS394	Oh dear, I'm starting to look old.
HBGT395	It's from all that drinking.
HBGS396	Mind your own business.
HBNN397	mirror frame
HBGS398	That jar's for my tips!
HBGS399	Put it back!
HBGT400	But I was going to put a whole lot of money in it... 
HBGT401	...too much for me to carry around with me... 
HBGT402	...so I'm going to have to take it with me and fill it up.
HBGS403	Oh. Okay, then.
HBGT404	Look! A three-headed monkey!
HBXM405	Ah, then the prophecies were true!  (gasp)
HBXM406	Where? I don't see anything.
HBGT407	He must've run away.
HBXM408	This is a very bad omen.
HBNN409	tarot cards
HBGS410	No, no, don't touch that. Ohhh...my head!
HBGS411	Oh, please, stop touching things. Stop that racket!
HBGS412	Leave that alone. And someone kill that man with the jackhammer!
HBGS413	Leave that alone. And turn down the lights, will you?
HBGS414	Oh, don't bother that. Just make the pain stop, please!
HBGS415	Please, stop touching things. I swear I'll never drink again!
HBGT416	I've already got one. Any more would be stealing.

HBGT432	That opened it.

HBGT455	Five `DEATH` cards. I think I'm getting the hint.

HBGT457	It's a tarot card that says `DEATH`.
HBGT458	I've got two `DEATH` cards.
HBGT459	Three `DEATH` cards. I wonder if that means something... 
HBGT460	Four `DEATH` cards. If I were the superstitious sort... 
HBGT461	I've got five `DEATH` cards. That can't be good.

HBGT483	There. I've poked holes in it.
HBGT484	It's already got holes in it.
HBGT485	I don't think the lid will fit that.
HBGT486	I need to use the jar lid with something else. A jar, for instance.
HBNZ487	nacho chip maker
HBGT488	I'm sure it's never been cleaned.

KGSO317	Give me some more lemonade, you little chiseler.
KGSO318	Goodbye, you little brigand.
KGKN319	Bye, mister.
KGKN320	Why? Was the lemonade bad?
KGGT321	I don't know, I didn't drink any.
KGKN322	Well, if you're not dissatisfied with our product I can't justify giving you a refund.
KGKN323	I'm sorry, but it's company policy.
KGGT324	But...
KGKN325	ThankYouHaveaNiceDayGoodbye.
KGKN326	You know, I'd really like to, but...
KGKN327	...what is it they always say? Ah, yes.
KGKN328	The customer is always a slave to the pitiless multinational corporations whose products they live to consume.
KGKN329	So...
KGKN330	No. Can I get you anything else?
KGKN331	Oh, gosh yes!
KGKN332	It's a very healthful drink!
KGKN333	Even better for you than placing leeches on your tongue.
KGGT334	Wow!
KGKN335	It's a dandy tonic for scurvy.
KGKN336	It'll cure all your symptoms, including, but not limited to:
KGKN337	...gradual weakening, aching muscles, sunken eyes, painful gums, ashen skin, loss of teeth...
KGKN338	...internal bleeding, the reopening of old wounds, diarrhea, kidney failure, fainting, halitosis and death.
KGKN339	No, but it has a refreshing citrus flavor with no unpleasant aftertaste.
KGKN340	Drinking.
KGGT341	Oh.
KGKN342	Sure. We have a bottomless mug policy, you know.
KGKN343	That'll be a nickel.
KGGT344	Hey!
KGGT345	There's no bottom to this mug!
KGGT346	Give me my money back!
KGKN347	I'm sorry. I did tell you about our bottomless mug policy.
KGKN348	And there are NO refunds.
KGGT349	Why you little...
KGGT350	This isn't very refreshing.
KGKN351	I guess you forgot about our bottomless mug policy.
KGGT352	Why am I wasting my money on this?
KGGT353	I'll never get any lemonade as long as he gives me a mug with no bottom.
KGKN354	Thank you! Come again!
KGGT355	Ahhhh. That was as refreshing as morning dew!
KGKN356	Hey!
KGKN357	How did you drink all the lemonade?
KGKN358	You switched mugs on me, you cheat!
KGKN359	I hope you're happy.
KGKN360	You've put a budding young entrepreneur out of business!
KGNN361	bottomless mug
L1GT301	Hello. Can you tell me how to find the evil smugglers of Skull Island?
L1LF302	Beats me.
L1LF303	Oh, wait a second. I think I remember something about that...
L1LF304	...at the Orientation Seminar. Let me think...
L1LF305	The cave is halfway down this sheer cliff face.
L1LF306	Climb on board this dumbwaiter! I, I, I'll lower you down.
L1GT307	It looks pretty rickety. Are you sure it's safe?
L1LF308	No.
L1LF309	Never ever used it before. But I'm sure it can't be THAT dangerous.
L1LF310	I'm a temp here. The usual elevator operator, Brawnbeard, he's sick, so I'm filling in.
L1GT311	I guess that'll be O.K. What's your name?
L1LF312	It's LaFoot.
L1NN313	Effete LaFoot
L1LF314	Yes?
L1SO315	Would you lower me down to the smugglers' cave?
L1SO316	Let's try that lowering-me-down-the-cliff thing again.
L1SO317	Do you think you'll be able to lower me down this time?
L1SO318	Just try lowering me, one more time.
L1SO319	Never mind.
L1LF320	Sure, I can do that.
L1LF321	You, You must weigh no more than, say, twenty pounds, right?
L1GT322	Actually, more like a hundred twenty.
L1LF323	Oh.
L1LF324	Well, it can't hurt to try, right?
L1LF325	All right. I think I'm getting better at this.
LDFS301	Our fearsome captain, the dread pirate LeCh... 
LDFS302	What's that, cap'n?
LDFS303	Yes, yes, I'm gettin' to it.
LDFS304	No, it's not the chicken delivery. It's that intruder.
LDFS305	Just a moment, sir. I'm with a customer.
LDFS306	No, sir. I don't know who took your toothbrush.
LDFS307	...has declared that this interloper, Guybrush Threepwood... 
LDFS308	...will suffer the most brutal and cleanest punishment known to the seas.
LDFS309	Any last words, Threepwood?
LDSO310	I regret that I have but one life to give for love!
LDSO311	I will never rest until I find Elaine!
LDSO312	I'll be back to kill you all!
LDSO313	Nope. Can't think of anything.
LDFS314	...has commanded that Guybrush Threepwood shall walk the plank!
LDFS315	All right. In you go.
LDFS316	That's odd. There was no splash.
LDGT317	SPLASH!
LDFS318	Ah.
LDFS319	That'll learn ye! 
LDGT320	So what do I do now?
LDFS321	Uh, hmm, I don't know. We've never done this before. Aren't you humiliated?
LDGT322	I guess so. But no more than usual.
LDFS323	Well... just get lost, then.
LDFS324	Who's there?
LDNZ325	door
LDGT326	They'd torture me for sure if I went in now.
LDGT327	Whoops! There's no rowboat!
LDNZ328	bucket-o-tar
LDGT329	It's a big old sloppy bucket o' tar.
LDGT330	I've had enough tar, thank you.
LDGT331	I can't use a whole bucket of tar!
LDGT332	Not even I could handle a gutful of tar.
LDNZ333	hold
LDGT334	How strange. The hold is full of broken luggage.
LPGT301	I'd better not. I think I'm starting to make that guy angry.
LPNZ302	plank
LPGT303	It's that plank I keep falling off.
LPGT304	It's the plank they made me walk.
LPGT305	Either it's a time-honored form of pirate torture... 
LPGT306	...or just a loose board.
LPGT307	I'll never be able to pick that up.
LPGT308	The plank is too thick to cut through with scissors.
LPNZ309	rowboat
LPGT310	It's my trusty rowboat.
LPNZ311	window
LPGT312	I don't want anyone to know I'm here.
LPGT313	That kind of window usually locks from the inside. I'll have to find another way in.
LPGT314	Looks like a light is on in the Captain's cabin.
LPNZ315	floating plank
LPGT316	It's the remnants of the ship's plank.
LPGT317	I don't need the plank.
LQGT301	I don't want anything that smelly.
LQGT302	I don't want to take biscuits from a gorilla.
LQGT303	They'd see me!
LQGT304	Yuck. This chicken grease washed off all the feathers.
LQGT305	Whoops. I'd better keep quiet.
LQFS306	Absolutely, Captain. I'll get right on it after I have my dinner.
LQFS307	What's that, Captain?
LQFS308	I eat TOO much fried chicken?
LQFS309	Well, I...I've just got a weakness for chicken, that's all.
LQFS310	I know you don't have any weaknesses, Captain LeChimp.
LQFS311	You're an over-achiever, a doer! While I'm just a tiny little fly.
LQGT312	LeChimp?
LQGT313	The captain is an ape?
LQGT314	Well, if the captain is an ape...
LQGT315	...then Mr. Fossey must be...
LQFS316	Aye, aye Captain!
LQFS317	Fresh bananas for the WHOLE CREW!
LQGT318	...an utter loon.
LQFS319	What's that, Captain? Your parasites are bothering ya?
LQFS320	Well of course I'll groom ya, sir.
LQFS321	You know sir, finding this gold statue may be just the boost our crew needs!
LQFS322	Why, with the riches we get from this, we can get new and better ships and become the terror of the Caribbean!
LQSQ323	Uh, Testing... testing... uh, check... one... two... uh, three...
LQFS324	Uh oh. I'm hearing the voices again.
LQSQ325	Uh, Captain LeChimp! uh, um I'm the REAL brains behind this crew!
LQFS326	Doh! What made me say that?
LQFS327	I'm terribly sorry, Captain.
LQSQ328	I'm not picking nits off you any more, Captain!
LQFS329	Doh!  Where did that come from?
LQSQ330	Yeah, this whole ship, it stinks like a zoo.  (Laugh)
LQFS331	Why do I keep saying these things?
LQSQ332	You, you think you could maybe shave your back? It's REALLY disgusting!
LQFS333	I don't know why I said that, sir -- I don't even think that!
LQSQ334	Uh, uh, per, per, Permission to speak freely, sir. You're a big, dumb monkey!
LQFS335	Maybe I need some time alone, sir.
LQFS336	I don't mean you any disrespect.
LQGT337	Mr. Fossey, I've been thinking...
LQFS338	Are you all right, Captain? You sound different.
LQGT339	Don't interrupt!
LQFS340	Sorry, sir!
LQGT341	Maybe it's time we gave up pirating.
LQGT342	I mean, take a look around, at me, the rest of the crew... 
LQGT343	...We're all monkeys.
LQFS344	You mean in the Darwinian sense, sir?
LQGT345	No, I mean in the quite literal sense.
LQGT346	Have you noticed that the crew is happier swinging from the masts than swabbing the decks?
LQGT347	I don't even want to MENTION what they've been flinging around the ship... 
LQFS348	Are you suggesting that I'm not disciplining the crew enough?
LQGT349	No, no, I'm suggesting that we all give up this charade and go back to the trees.
LQGT350	That's the life for a monkey, not sailing the seas for months on end!
LQFS351	Well, if you feel so strongly about it, sir, I suppose I can't argue.
LQGT352	I think our last order of business should be to dig up that statue, and... 
LQFS353	It'll be tough on the men sir, but I'll tell them that you think it best.
LQGT354	Okay, but first, we should dig up that statue and give it... 
LQFS355	I'll make sure they understand that it's not their fault... 
LQGT356	Very good, and then we can dig up that statue... 
LQGT357	Okay, never mind then.
LQNZ358	porthole
LQGT359	It leads out to my rowboat.
LQGT360	If I climb out this porthole, I'll wind up floating on the plank I cut.
LQGT361	It's already clean.
LQNZ362	LeChimp
LQGT363	It's the dread pirate LeChimp.
LQGT364	I think Mr. Fossey is the only guy who can talk to him.
LQNZ365	Mr. Fossey
LQGT366	It's Mr. Fossey, the first mate.
LQGT367	If he knows I'm here, he might do something even more horrible to me.
LQGT368	That's fun, but it doesn't seem to be making any difference.
LQNZ369	treasure map
LQGT370	That must be the map to where they've buried Elaine!
LQNZ371	chicken grease
LQGT372	It's all over everything.
LQGT373	It's a greasy, sloppy mess all over the chicken bucket.
LQGT374	Chicken grease won't do any good with that.
LQGT375	I need to use the chicken grease with something else.
LQGT376	Mmmmm. Greasy.
LQNZ377	tickets
LQGT378	It's two tickets for the Long John Silver Center for the Performing Arts.
LQGT379	I don't go for all that high-brow artsy theater stuff.
LQNZ380	fruit
LQGT381	It's a bowl of fruit.
LQGT382	I'm not in the mood for fruit.
LQNZ383	bananas
LQGT384	It's a bowl of bananas.
LQGT385	I'm not in the mood for bananas.
LQNZ386	bananas
LQNZ387	'mashed potatoes'
LQGT388	Oh, that's disgusting.
LQGT389	I can't believe anyone would order BlondeBeard's 'Taters.'
LQGT390	Looks like mashed potatoes.
LQGT391	I'm not that interested in mashed potatoes right now.
LQGT392	I hear gorillas are touchy about stealing their food.
LQNZ393	cranberries
LQGT394	Now THAT's a lot of cranberries.
LQGT395	I never liked cranberries, and I don't plan to start now.
LQNZ396	corn-on-the-cob
LQGT397	I didn't know corn grew in the tropics.
LQGT398	I don't want to get the kernels stuck in my teeth.
LQGT399	No, the corn is all buttery and greasy.
LQNZ400	salt and pepper
LQGT401	Salt and pepper shakers.
LQGT402	Salt and pepper alone aren't very tasty.
LQGT403	I avoid salt whenever possible, and ONLY use fresh ground pepper.
LQNZ404	butter
LQGT405	A stick of butter.
LQGT406	Ewww.
LQGT407	If I pick it up it will melt in my pants.
LQNZ408	place setting
LQGT409	Lovely place setting for a gorilla.
LQGT410	There's no food on the plate.
LQNZ411	tasty, buttery biscuits
LQGT412	Hey...
LQGT413	...I wonder how soon those will sprout flies?
LQGT414	I've GOT to try those biscuits sometime.
LQGT415	I don't want another biscuit.
LQGT416	Oh yeah, like I want another mouthful of maggots.
LQGT417	I don't want to take biscuits from a gorilla.
LQNZ418	bread
LQGT419	Mmmm. My favorite...
LQGT420	...Plunder Bread!
LQGT421	Nah, I don't want any Plunder Bread.
LQGT422	I can't imagine any need for a loaf of Plunder Bread.
LQNZ423	pitcher
LQNZ424	stein
LQGT425	Yuck.
LQGT426	That's that heifer beer.
LQGT427	It's some smelly, smelly stuff.
LQGT428	What could I possibly use that for?
LQGT429	Oh, be serious!
LQNZ430	vinegar
LQGT431	It's a carafe of balsamic vinegar.
LQGT432	Vinegar isn't brewed for drinking.
LQGT433	I think I'll leave that here.
LQNZ434	tire swing
LQGT435	It's a tire swing.
LQGT436	I don't like to chew anything a gorilla sat on.
LQNZ437	pitcher
LQGT438	Eww, It's a porcelain pitcher.
LQNZ439	hay
LQGT440	It's a bed of hay.
LQGT441	It doesn't look too appetizing.
LQGT442	I don't want any smelly old hay.
LQNZ443	vase
LQGT444	Agh! It's a porcelain vase.
LXSO301	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate!
LXSO302	Aren't you afraid the volcano will destroy your village?
LXSO303	Stand aside! I mean to visit the volcano!
LXSO304	When does the ceremony begin?
LXSO305	Who is your featured guest?
LXSO306	What does your guest look like, again?
LXSO307	You look familiar, somehow.
LXSO308	I REALLY want to see the volcano.
LXSO309	I bring a gift for the volcano god!
LXSO310	I'm thinking of becoming a cannibal.
LXSO311	I'm not afraid of you vicious, bloodthirsty cannibals!
LXSO312	Nice village you have.
LXSO313	Do you live in fear of the fruit fly menace?
LXSO314	Do they hassle you when you go through customs?
LXSO315	Nice village you have.
LXSO316	Whoops! I'll be going now.
LXSO317	Gotta run. Bye.
LXSO318	I'll see you around.
LXNN319	Lemonhead
LXLH320	A pirate, huh?
LXLH321	Well, then you must realize the inherent danger in wandering into a village populated by cannibals.
LXGT322	I'm Guybrush...
LXGT323	...boy am I getting tired of saying this...
LXGT324	...Threepwood.
LXGT325	Mighty pirate...yadayadayada.
LXLH326	I am Lemonhead.
LXLH327	Can I help you with something?
LXLH328	Perhaps it's because I look like a big lemon.
LXGT329	Oh, yeah!
LXGT330	But it's more than that.
LXGT331	We've met before.
LXGT332	Back on Monkey Island.
LXLH333	Thanks.
LXLH334	It's not much but we call it home.
LXLH335	We've been doing our best to capture the classic charm of a headhunter village...
LXLH336	...while at the same time incorporating all the modern conveniences brought to us by the European explorers.
LXLH337	You may have noticed our first state-of-the-art bloodletting clinic...
LXLH338	...which has been cleverly designed to look like a traditional shaman's hut.
LXGT339	How quaint!
LXLH340	Yes, we think so.
LXLH341	The volcano?
LXLH342	Oh, no.
LXLH343	Not since I switched to a malathion-based cologne.
LXGT344	Very alluring.
LXLH345	Thank you.
LXLH346	You have no idea.
LXLH347	Thanks.
LXLH348	Ah, Monkey Island.
LXLH349	We had a nice village there.
LXLH350	Rent controlled huts, close to the good schools.
LXLH351	Those were the salad days, so to speak, until they put in that darned carnival.
LXGT352	Carnival!?
LXLH353	Yes, carnival.
LXLH354	Just as soon as they put up the first tent...
LXLH355	...WHOOSH...
LXLH356	...the whole place becomes TRENDY.
LXLH357	Sailors coming in all times of the night...
LXLH358	...that awful music droning on and on...
LXLH359	...and to be honest with you, I think the midway games are rigged.
LXGT360	Yeah, yeah.
LXLH361	At night, it wasn't safe for a cannibal to walk the island alone.
LXSO362	Cannibals?!
LXSO363	Lovely weather we're having today.
LXSO364	You know, I can hold my breath underwater for 10 minutes.
LXSO365	Look out! The volcano is erupting! Run for your lives!
LXLH366	You say that like it's a bad thing.
LXLH367	Well, it's true.
LXLH368	Yes.
LXLH369	Lovely.
LXGT370	I guess you're going to eat me now.
LXLH371	To be honest, the thought had crossed my mind.
LXLH372	I see. What if the water is boiling?
LXLH373	Do you think you could last about 45 minutes?
LXLH374	It's been so long since I've made any bouillon.
LXLH375	How I did LOVE bouillon.
LXGT376	<Gulp>
LXLH377	You're not fooling anyone, pirate-boy.
LXLH378	That volcano isn't going to erupt.
LXLH379	But we are no longer vicious and bloodthirsty cannibals.
LXGT380	No?
LXLH381	No.
LXLH382	We underwent a paradigm shift in our belief system several years ago.
LXSO383	Really? That's fascinating.
LXSO384	A paradigm shift? You don't say?
LXSO385	Pair of dimes?
LXSO386	Wow. That's heavy.
LXLH387	We decided we wanted to live the healthy cannibal lifestyle.
LXLH388	Completely cut back on our fatty missionary intake and went vegetarian altogether.
LXLH389	But there certainly was a time I would have eaten you.
LXLH390	Young guy like you, not too much muscle...
LXGT391	Hey!
LXLH392	I'd probably marinate you in white wine for forty-five minutes...
LXLH393	...dip you in a light corn batter...
LXLH394	...wrap you in banana leaves and bury you in a pit with a hundred hot coals...
LXLH395	...let you roast overnight...
LXLH396	...then I'd serve you on a bed of basmati rice...
LXLH397	...with a garnish of shitake mushrooms and shallots.
LXLH398	Mmmmm...
LXGT399	But not anymore, right?
LXLH400	Mmmmmmmmmm...
LXGT401	But, but not anymore, RIGHT!
LXLH402	Huh?
LXLH403	Oh...yeah. Right, right.
LXLH404	Mt. Acidophilus is completely harmless.
LXLH405	We have curried favor with Sherman, the all-powerful god of the volcano.
LXGT406	The god of the volcano likes spicy foods?
LXLH407	Shut up, or I'll eat you.
LXGT408	O.K.
LXLH409	When we first landed on this island, the volcano god was most upset.
LXLH410	Belching out smoke...
LXLH411	...vomiting up lava.
LXLH412	It was disgusting, really.
LXLH413	And potentially hazardous.
LXLH414	We knew we had to do something to pacify the volcano god and we assumed a good sacrifice would do the trick.
LXGT415	A reasonable assumption.
LXLH416	But when we threw the sacrifice into the volcano, Mt. Acidophilus erupted violently.
LXLH417	We thought Sherman was upset at us, so we started making sacrifices every day.
LXLH418	We tried everything...
LXLH419	...fish, poultry, livestock, phenylalanine...
LXGT420	The usual.
LXLH421	Then one day we tried brie.
LXLH422	There was a huge eruption that nearly killed us all!
LXGT423	What happened?
LXLH424	Sherman is lactose intolerant.
LXGT425	Ah. It all makes sense now.
LXLH426	Now, Sherman is on a very strict diet.
LXLH427	He only gets fresh fruit, vegetables...
LXLH428	...and of course soy products for the proteins so important to muscle-building.
LXLH429	I'm afraid I cannot allow that.
LXLH430	Our ritual offering is about to begin.
LXGT431	Terrific! I'm fascinated by your quaint tribal customs!
LXLH432	Postcards and slides are available in the lobby.
LXLH433	Non-cannibals are forbidden from witnessing the actual ceremony.
LXGT434	That's so unfair!
LXLH435	Tell it to the volcano gods. I don't make the rules, you know.
LXLH436	It was supposed to have started half an hour ago.
LXLH437	Even now, members of my village are preparing a human-like sacrifice for the volcano god.
LXGT438	Human-like?
LXLH439	Due to the delicate nature of the volcano god's digestion we can't actually feed him real humans.
LXLH440	So we sacrifice a human substitute.
LXLH441	It doesn't really taste like a human, but it has a similar texture.
LXGT442	So what's the hold-up?
LXLH443	We're still waiting for our featured guest.
LXLH444	He's an ambassador from one of the other islands.
LXLH445	It's all part of a new Cannibal Outreach program between the villages.
LXLH446	Apparently not all villages are as punctual as ours.
LXGT447	Uh... I'll help you find him. What does he look like?
LXLH448	I don't know. He should be dressed for the ceremony.
LXLH449	And he'd better be a vegetarian. We specifically asked for a vegetarian.
LXLH450	I've never seen him, but he should be dressed for the ceremony.
LXLH451	You're just not a cannibal, and your presence would defile the sanctity of our ceremony.
LXGT452	Oh, can't you make an exception just this once? It's an emergency!
LXLH453	I'd like to, but if I let you in, then I'd have to let everybody in.
LXLH454	Next thing you know, cannibalism is `in`, and they're making documentaries about us.
LXLH455	Oh, we can't take gifts from outsiders.
LXLH456	Government regulations, health codes, taboos, that sort of thing.
LXLH457	I'll send him your regards, though.
LXLH458	Do you have any previous experience?
LXGT459	Well, I used to bite my fingernails.
LXLH460	Hmmm. Well, technically, I'm not supposed to do this...
LXLH461	...but I like you. You got moxie.
LXLH462	After the sacrifice, I'll get you started on your cannibalism orientation program.
LXLH463	In just four short years, you'll be able to join us in the volcano ritual!
LXGT464	Four years? Uh... wait a second.
LXGT465	Did I say `cannibal?`
LXGT466	I, uh, meant to say... err, `cannon... ball.`
LXGT467	I want to be a cannon ball. BOOOOOMM!
LXLH468	You're not quite stable, are you?
LXBT469	Wait! Choosing that one will be your undoing!
LXBT470	Stop! You are making a grave mistake!
LXBT471	No! That's the wrong choice!
LXBT472	Don't choose THAT one!
LXBT473	Oh, please! No. No! Pick another!
LXBT474	Pick this one and you're really in trouble.
LXBT475	You will surely be punished if you pick that one.
LXBT476	I'm warning you. Choose that one and you'll die.
LTGT301	Perfect.
LTGT302	The lighthouse is working now.
LTGT303	Perfect.
LTGT304	The lighthouse is working now.
LTNZ305	mirror
LTGT306	It's broken.
LTGT307	It's working perfectly.
LTGT308	There's a mirror now, but there's no light for it to reflect.
LTGT309	I don't have anything to replace it with.
LTGT310	This mirror will work fine. I don't need to take it.
LTNZ311	lantern post
LTGT312	This is where the lighthouse light would go, if it had one.
LTGT313	There's no light.
LTNZ314	lantern
LTGT315	The light is on, but there's no mirror to reflect the light.
LTGT316	It's working beautifully.
LTGT317	And be responsible for a naval catastrophe? I don't think so.
LTNZ318	lens
LTGT319	It concentrates the light into a beacon for wayward vessels. Makes a man proud.
LTGT320	Luckily, I don't need to adjust it.
LTGT321	Boy! It's windy up here!
LTGT322	With all these broken windows, it's no wonder the light blew out.
LLGT301	I can't do that from here!
LLGT302	There isn't enough room to run the little guy.
LLLI303	My name's LeChuckie!
LLLI304	You're my favorite sailor!
LLLI305	Ahoy there, matey!
LLLI306	I want to be your friend!
LLLI307	Will you play with me?
LLLI308	You're the best shipmate ever!
LLLI309	Arrgh! Math be hard! Let's go shoppin'!
LLLI310	Land Ho, Sailor!
LLLI311	Set sail for fun!
LLLI312	Let's bury some treasure!
LLLI313	Let's build a sand castle!
LLLI314	I'll rip out your lungs, ya swab!
LLLI315	I'll keel-haul yer mother!
LLLI316	I'll tear off yer head and spit bile down your throat!
LLLI317	You see yer doom before ye!
LLLI318	I'll hang ye from me yardarm with yer own entrails!
LLLI319	I'll infect ye with scurvy and rot yer teeth to blackened stumps!
LLLI320	I'll chop ye to bits and feed ye to the sharks!
LLLI321	I'll be haunting ye into the hereafter!
LLLI322	I'll grind yer bones ta make me toothpaste!
LLLI323	I'll cut out yer tongue, and make ye eat it in a sandwich!
LLLI324	Just you wait 'til you fall asleep, little boy.
LGGT001	This is no time to be indulging myself.
LGGT002	That's made my voice sound funny.

LGPC011	when the project is closer to being finished.
LGPC012	So, please sit back and enjoy the
LGPC013	good
LGPC014	clean
LGPC015	adventure game fun
LGPC016	Tim Schafer would like it made clear
LGPC017	that while he is bitter about not being given adequate credit
LGPC018	for Monkey Island 1 and 2
LGPC019	that he is in NO WAY associated with this game
LGPC020	until he sees if it is really any good
LGPC021	at which time he will remind everyone that Guybrush Threepwood
LGPC022	was really HIS idea.
LGNZ023	helium balloons
LGGT024	They're very festive.
LGGT025	It's a helium-filled balloon.
LGGT026	I can't use a balloon with that.
LGGT027	They're fun, but I need to use them with something else.
LGGT028	It's fun, but I need to use it with something else.
LGGT301	I can't get the paperweight from here.
LGGT302	I don't want to pop the fun balloons.
MCGT301	I'm afraid the salt in the sea water might corrode the screw-on metal top.
MCGT302	This knife might cut through regular wood, but not a rubber tree.
MCGT303	The label on the bottle says, `Paste will not adhere to dental work, hair, or cannon balls.` Darn.
MCGT304	That wood is too hard for the biscuit cutter to cut.
MTGT301	I can't reach.
MTGT302	Murray, do your stuff!
MTMR303	Okay!
MTMR304	Boo!
MTGA305	Ahhh!
MTMR306	Mortal fool! Release me from this wretched tomb!
MTMR307	I must be set free or I will haunt you forever!
MTMR308	I will hide your keys beneath the cushions of your upholstered furniture...
MTMR309	...and NEVERMORE will you be able to find socks that match!
MTGA310	All right, hang on, I'm coming.
MTGT311	Great work, Murray!
MTMR312	I...I was terrifying, wasn't I?
MTMR313	My demonic powers have made me OMNIPOTENT! Bwahahahahahahaha!
MTGT314	Uh, oh. Looks like the lantern ran out of oil.
MTGA315	There! It's open!
MTGA316	Now shuffle off and give me peace!
MTGT317	Murray, say something scary.
MTMR318	Booo! HA HA HA! I am a fearsome skull!
MTMR319	I don't think it's working, Guybrush.
MTGT320	I'd better think of something else.
MTGT321	Hey. Murray, be fearsome!
MTMR322	Okay!
MTMR323	Booo!
MTMR324	I am one of the living dead!
MTMR325	Fear me!
MTMR326	Release me!
MTMR327	Hey!
MTMR328	Look at me!
MTMR329	I'm a ghost, here!
MTGA330	That's just pathetic.
MTGT331	That can reach the lantern, but it won't grab hold.
MTGT332	I've got it!
MTGA333	Hey! What happened to the light?
MTNZ334	lantern
MTGT335	It's a glowing lantern.
MTGT336	It's blown out.
MTGT337	I can't shed any light on that.
MTGT338	It feels warm.
MTNZ339	poster
MTGT340	It's a poster for, `Suckers XII: The Beaking.`
MTNZ341	hanged Smuggle Bunny
MTGT342	Cloying, yet grisly at the same time.
MTNZ343	parrot
MTGT344	It's either a dead parrot, or a very strange bat.
MTNZ345	LeChuck mask
MTGT346	Looks like a Halloween mask.
MTNZ347	pulpy books
MTGT348	It's a bunch of cheesy horror stories.
MTNZ349	Mort's novel
MTGT350	It looks like he's writing a horror novel.
MTGT351	It's called, `The Grog that Drank People.`
MTGT352	'Part one of a three book cycle.'
MTGT353	I wonder why trashy media always comes in threes?
MTNZ354	poster
MTGT355	It's a poster for some dumb book about undead pirates.
MTNZ356	dinosaur doll
MTGT357	It's a dinosaur from `The Monsters that Time Couldn't Care Less About.`
MTNZ358	Mort
MTGT359	That must be the gravedigger.
MTGT360	I bet that would really give him the creeps, but I can't reach him.
MTNZ361	werewolf
MTGT362	Spooky.
MTNZ363	raven
MTGT364	It's the stuff that really boring dreams are made of.
MTNZ365	poster
MTGT366	It's the poster for some really trashy monster book.
MTGT367	Trust me. It'll never sell.
MTNZ368	trophy
MTGT369	It's hard to see what it is from where I'm standing.
MTGT370	Judging by the beard, I'm guessing it's a goat.
MTNZ371	trophy
MTGT372	Oh, dear.
MTNZ373	trophy
MTGT374	What a bore.
MTNZ375	shadow
MTGT376	My shadow is being cast on that back wall.
MVGT301	I'd love to stay and chat, but...uh... I've got to go.
MVSO302	How'd you get all the way up there?
MVSO303	Do you need me to help you down?
MVSO304	What are you doing up there?
MVSO305	How long are you going to keep doing that?
MVSO306	You seem restless.
MVSO307	Do you know anything about lifting curses?
MVSO308	I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to go.
MVMR309	Through sheer force of will.
MVGT310	Uh huh.
MVMR311	All right, it was a bunch of those weird voodoo kids.
MVMR312	They found me on shore and put me on top of this spike, all the time thinking they were so funny.
MVMR313	Help? I need no help from you foolish mortals!
MVMR314	I am Murray! The all-powerful demonic skull!
MVGT315	Okay, just thought I'd ask.
MVMR316	Don't get me wrong; I do appreciate the offer.
MVMR317	I am standing as a testament...
MVGT318	Standing?
MVMR319	...hanging as a testament to the power of the forces of Evil that will one day claim victory over the entire earth!
MVMR320	As long as it takes.
MVGT321	Must get pretty dull up there, I suppose.
MVMR322	Never! The powers of darkness are never dull! We will one day prove that...
MVMR323	...oh, who am I trying to fool? I'm bored out of my skull.
MVMR324	Figuratively speaking, of course.
MVMR325	Oh, I don't know. It's just that not many people come through this swamp.
MVGT326	What would you rather be doing?
MVMR327	I need to be out among the lesser people, terrifying them and causing pain and misery.
MVGT328	That would make you happy?
MVMR329	Yes, happy, in a dark, demonic way.
MVMR330	Oh, right. I know a lot about lifting curses.
MVMR331	That's why I'm a disembodied talking skull sitting on top of a spike in the middle of a swamp.
MVGT332	You seem bitter.
MVMR333	I'm sorry. It's been a rough day.
MRSO001	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate!
MRSO002	Lose something?
MRSO003	Can I call you BOB?
MRSO004	I'm Guybrush. Sorry about blasting your boat.
MRMR005	I'm Murray,...
MRMR006	...the demonic skeleton...
MRMR007	...uh...
MRMR008	...the mighty demonic skull!
MRMR009	And I'm in need of some bones!
MRMR010	Maybe I'll just take yours!
MRMR011	Bwahahahaha!
MRGT012	What are you going to do?
MRGT013	Head-butt me?
MRMR014	I'll...
MRMR015	I'll...
MRMR016	I'll think of something.
MRMR017	I am Murray!
MRMR018	The invincible, demonic skull!
MRMR019	Quake in fear, mortal!
MRMR020	For your insolence, I shall now devour you!
MRGT021	Uh-huh.
MRMR022	Could you...
MRMR023	...er...
MRMR024	Could you pick me up, so I can bite you?
MRGT025	No.
MRMR026	I just thought I'd ask.
MRMR027	You may call me Murray!
MRMR028	I'm a powerful demonic force!
MRMR029	I'm the harbinger of your doom!
MRMR030	And the forces of darkness will applaud me as I STRIDE through the gates of hell carrying your head on a pike!
MRGT031	'Stride?'
MRMR032	Alright then, 'ROLL! ROLL through the gates of hell.'
MRMR033	Must you take the fun out of everything?
MRMR034	Then that sorrow will be the last thing you feel!
MRMR035	You have come face to face with the terrible demon skull Murray!
MRMR036	Now, let me hear your screams of terror!
MRSO037	Eeek.
MRSO038	Aaah.
MRSO039	Ooooh.
MRSO040	I'm too petrified to say anything.
MRMR041	Bwahahahahahahaha!
MRSO042	Why do you villains always laugh so much?
MRSO043	You're about as fearsome as a doorstop.
MRSO044	You know, you'd look great with a melting candle on your forehead.
MRSO045	It's been swell talking to ya.
MRMR046	I wasn't laughing about anything in particular.
MRMR047	Somewhere, there's a fish nibbling on my foot and it really tickles.
MRMR048	Is it a really EVIL looking doorstop?
MRGT049	Uh, never mind.
MRMR050	I get the feeling you're not taking me very seriously.
MRGT051	No, I am. Really.
MRMR052	Really?
MRMR053	Then let me hear you scream in terror!
MRGT054	Really.
MRMR055	That's great!
MRMR056	Run, then!
MRMR057	Run!
MRMR058	RUN away from the fearsome skull!
MRMR059	Until you die, I shall revisit you in your most horrible nightmares! (Laugh)
MRGT060	Whatever.
MRSO061	Was your mother's father bald, too?
MRSO062	Well, at least now you never have to worry about what to wear.
MRSO063	How can you see without eyeballs?
MRSO064	I'm going now.
MRMR065	I'm not bald!
MRMR066	I just have a really high widows peak.
MRMR067	Well, I suppose that's true.
MRGT068	And accessorizing is really easy.
MRMR069	That's also true.
MRMR070	And I look good in hats.
MRGT071	There you go.
MRMR072	How can you walk around without a brain?
MRMR073	Some things no one can answer.
MRMR074	Good.
MRMR075	Now leave me alone!
MRMR076	I have a lot of scheming and evil plotting to do. (Laugh)
MRGT077	I'm going now.
MRMR078	Good.
MRMR079	Now leave me alone!
MRMR080	I have a lot of scheming and evil plotting to do.
MRNN301	Murray
OSGT301	That's weird. I didn't think dandruff... 
OSGT302	...moved... 
OSGT303	Oh!
OSNN304	lice
OSGT305	You're just going to have to take my word for it.
OSGT306	I don't need a prop.
OSGT307	It's an old travel trunk.
OSGT308	It's covered with stickers from many far-away places.
OSGT309	Hey, hey!
OSGT310	It's a sticker from Blood Island!
OSGT311	It says `Blood Island is for Bleeders... 
OSGT312	...a message from the Blood Island Tourism Council.`
OSGT313	Maybe the performer who owns this trunk knows how to get to Blood Island!
OSGT314	Looks like a nice coat... 
OSGT315	...with just a few flakes of unsightly dandruff.
OSGT316	I'd hate people to think less of this guy just because of a slight problem with...
OSGT317	Hey, this isn't dandruff... 
OSGT318	Oh!
OSNN319	lice
OSGT320	Watch me make THIS disappear.
OSGT321	Nothing up my sleeve... 
OSGT322	Presto!
OSGT323	Hey, it worked! There's something inside!
OSGT324	I'm not in the mood for any magic right now.
OSNZ325	pirate coat
OSGT326	It's a lice-infested pirate coat.
OSGT327	It'd be a nice coat if it weren't for that dandruff.
OSGT328	It's a de-loused pirate coat.
OSGT329	Looks too big for me.
OSNZ330	dandruff
OSGT331	They're, uh, wiggling.
OSGT332	So which one of you is the head louse?
OSGT333	I'd really rather not.
OSGT334	I don't know how to use lice with that.
OSGT335	I don't like the way these feel in my hand.
OSNZ336	pocket
OSGT337	It looks like there's something inside the pocket of this coat.
OSGT338	There's a glove in here.
OSNZ339	glove
OSGT340	It's a glove.
OSGT341	The glove won't work with that.
OSGT342	This glove isn't my size.
OSGT343	It's not a rubber glove.
OSGT344	I don't think that glove will fit.
OSNZ345	magic wand
OSGT346	It's a magic wand.
OSGT347	The magic wand has no effect on that.
OSGT348	The magic powers need to be focused on something else.
OSNZ349	magic hat
OSGT350	It's empty... 
OSGT351	...or is it?
OSGT352	There's a book inside.
OSGT353	I don't want to disturb the mystic powers of the hat.
OSGT354	I don't want to take advantage of the mystic energies.
OSNZ355	book
OSGT356	`The A-mfggh-C's of Ventriloquism`
OSNN357	ventriloquism book
OSGT358	That'd be a one-way ticket to a nasty paper cut.
OSGT359	It's a book about ventriloquism.
OSGT360	I don't want to throw my voice there.
OSGT361	It's an interesting read on its own, but I should try it out on somebody.
OSNZ362	cannon balls
OSGT363	It looks like he's going to juggle these cannon balls.
OSGT364	I don't want to haul those cannon balls around.
OSNZ365	worn travel trunk
OSGT366	It looks too heavy for me to carry.
OSGT367	It won't talk back.
OSSQ368	Please someone help! I'm trapped inside this trunk!
OSNZ369	Blood Island sticker
OSGT370	It is stuck to the trunk.
OSGT371	Licking it won't get it off.
OSNZ372	fake sword
OSGT373	It's a fake sword.
OSNZ374	fake swords
OSGT375	Just some fake swords.
OSNZ376	fake poison
OSGT377	It's just another prop.
OSNZ378	fake spears
OSGT379	They're some fake spears.
OSGT380	No, I don't have the hands of a spear-carrier.
OSNZ381	donkey head
OSGT382	It's a donkey mask.
OSGT383	I don't want to look like a jackass.
OSGT384	Yeah, yeah. I know what you're thinking.
OSGT385	So knock it off!
OSSQ386	Hi, I'm Frank. I'm a talking donkey. I fight crime!
OSNZ387	drama masks
OSGT388	It's some goofy drama masks.
OSSQ389	Hi, I'm Comedy Mask!
OSSQ390	And I'm Tragedy Mask.
OSSQ391	When your sister was in high-school, we were on her bedroom wall!
OSNZ392	wig
OSGT393	It's very mod.
OSGT394	No. I like the natural look.
OSGT395	Say hello to the folks, Harry!
OSSQ396	Hello, folks!
OSNZ397	mirror
OSGT398	I wonder if there's a part in this play for...
OSGT399	...a dashing, rogue chicken?
OSGT400	...a dashing, rogue pirate?
OSNZ401	fake crown
PDSO301	I'm Guybrush Threepwood.
PDSO302	I don't think you understand. I'm a mighty pirate.
PDSO303	It's me again, Guybrush Threepwood.
PDSO304	Now, look here, hock-meat!
PDSO305	Now look here, you blanched bonehead!
PDSO306	Wow! You're pale!
PDSO307	I've seen correctional fluids with better color than you!
PDSO308	You look like you've lived under a rock your WHOLE life!
PDSO309	You've got the SAVAGE pale!
PDSO310	Hey! I can see my reflection in your chest!
PDSO311	You're so pale, you make snow look tan!
PDSO312	If I bleached chalk it wouldn't be as pale as you!
PDSO313	Would you like to join my crew?
PDSO314	Are you sure you won't join my crew?
PDSO315	I'm looking for Blood Island. Do you know where it is?
PDSO316	Are you sure you don't know how to get to Blood Island.
PDSO317	Please let me see the map to Blood Island.
PDSO318	See ya around.
PDNN319	Palido
PDPL320	Very nice to meet you Mr. Threewood.
PDPL321	I am Palido.
PDPL322	Palido Domingo.
PDPL323	I am so glad you're here.
PDGT324	Finally...
PDGT325	...someone on this island with some manners.
PDPL326	My drink needs refreshing.
PDPL327	Take it away and bring me another.
PDPL328	I'm sorry, babe. I really, sincerely am.
PDPL329	Perhaps I didn't use the magic word.
PDPL330	Take this drink away and bring me another...
PDPL331	...NOW.
PDGT332	It's me again...
PDPL333	How nice.
PDPL334	Look...babe...
PDPL335	You know I love your work, and I respect you as an artist. But...
PDGT336	Now look here...
PDPL337	Bring me a drink.
PDPL338	Now!
PDPL339	Now hurry up and get me that drink.
PDPL340	Get my drink and make it snappy!
PDPL341	Get me that drink!
PDPL342	If it gets here quickly there's a nickel in it for you.
PDPL343	Go get me that drink.
PDPL344	Look! Babe...
PDPL345	I haven't been sunbathing for very long, so cut me some slack.
PDGT346	How long have you been out here?
PDPL347	Since June.
PDPL348	Oh, and by the way...
PDPL349	Happy new year.
PDPL350	Since July.
PDPL351	Since August.
PDPL352	Since September.
PDPL353	Since October.
PDPL354	Since November.
PDPL355	Since December.
PDPL356	Since January.
PDPL357	Since February.
PDPL358	Since March.
PDPL359	Since April.
PDPL360	Since May.
PDPL361	My complexion is a little on the light side, I'll give you that.
PDPL362	But soon, I'll be a bronzed god!
PDPL363	Please...babe...
PDPL364	You say any more I will become very self-conscious.
PDPL365	Thank you for your keen insight my friend.
PDPL366	Why don't you go do something useful now...
PDPL367	...like inhale a puffer-fish.
PDPL368	Okay, babe?
PDPL369	Be quiet now.
PDPL370	All right!
PDPL371	ALL RIGHT!
PDPL372	YES!
PDPL373	I'm very pale!
PDPL374	Thank YOU!
PDPL375	There!
PDPL376	You've hurt me deeply and you KNOW I mean it!
PDPL377	Are you happy?
PDPL378	Huh? Babe?
PDPL379	Are you happy?
PDPL380	Are you happy NOW?
PDGT381	Yes.
PDPL382	I hate you.
PDPL383	Get me a drink.
PDPL384	Yeah babe...
PDPL385	I'm not the tannest cat around.
PDPL386	But...
PDPL387	...as you can see, I am working on it.
PDPL388	Oh no, babe.
PDPL389	I'm not a sailor.
PDPL390	I make my living off the hard work and talent of others.
PDGT391	You're a project leader on a computer game?
PDPL392	No, no.
PDPL393	I'm a high-powered talent agent. Major stars. We're talkin' MAJOR stars here.
PDPL394	Don't talk to me about work, babe.
PDPL395	I'm tanning.
PDPL396	Nope.
PDPL397	Never heard of it.
PDPL398	I told you before, babe...
PDPL399	...I've never heard of Blood Island.
PDGT400	That's funny.
PDGT401	Slappy Cromwell...
PDGT402	That guy at the theater...
PDGT403	...told me you booked all his shows there.
PDGT404	Is that a fact?
PDGT405	Well I have a document here that says you booked Slappy Cromwell's act at a resort on Blood Island.
PDPL406	You can see it when I roll over to tan my back.
PDPL407	But babe...that may be a VERY long while.
PDPL408	Cromwell!
PDPL409	I should have known.
PDPL410	If I booked that guy in a dinghy there'd be empty seats.
PDGT411	So you do know how to get to Blood Island!
PDPL412	Yeah, yeah!
PDPL413	They had a really nice room there, too.
PDPL414	`The Goodsoup Plantation Resort Hotel and Casino.`
PDPL415	It was THE place to go before they moved the shipping lanes.
PDPL416	I used to book so many gigs there I had the map tattooed on my back.
PDGT417	On your back?
PDPL418	All those little yellow sticky notes just kept getting lost.
PDGT419	Why did you lie and say you didn't know how to get to Blood Island?
PDPL420	I...I just don't want to say.
PDGT421	What?
PDPL422	It's your face babe.
PDPL423	There! I said it, babe. I hope you can forgive me. I just gotta be honest.
PDPL424	I just didn't think you were the right type for Blood Island.
PDPL425	That's not some place I picture your career going right now.
PDPL426	Let me get you a booking somewhere that's in your league.
PDPL427	I can gig you at this little shoe factory in Hoboken.
PDGT428	It's Blood Island or nothing.
PDPL429	If that's the way it's gotta be babe, then that's the way it's gotta be.
PDPL430	But you're gonna have to find new representation. O.K.?
PDGT431	Can I see your map to Blood Island?
PDPL432	You can see it when I roll over to tan my back.
PDGT433	When will that be?
PDPL434	It could be a long time, babe.
PDPL435	A very...
PDPL436	...VERY...
PDPL437	...long time.

PSGT309	Let's rock.
PSGT310	Cool!
PSGT311	I don't need another one.
PSNZ312	box lid
PSGT313	It's the lid to the box of pistols.
PSNZ314	pistol
PSGT315	It's a loaded pistol.
PSGT316	That doesn't need to be shot.
PSGT317	What should I shoot?
PSNZ318	box lid
PSGT319	It's the lid to the box of pistols, and it's closed.

PSGT321	It's a banjo case.

PSGT323	The banjo case is empty.

POGT301	It's nailed to the wall.
POGT302	Although it's hauntingly realistic, I don't think it will talk back.
POGT303	There. I've cut out the face.
POGS304	Ah, there's nothing like family!
POGS305	No matter what may happen in the topsy-turvy world of the Caribbean resort business... 
POGS306	...I can always relax in the knowledge that I come from good, wealthy stock.
POGS307	Breeding!
POGS308	That's what's important.
POGS309	Breeding, and culture.
POGS310	Just like Grandfather Lambert.
POGS311	Breeding, culture, and lots and lots of really old money.
POGS312	It makes a man proud.
POGS313	That's funny, I don't remember Grandfather Lambert as looking so...so 
POGS314	...common.
POGS315	(Weird, it's like his eyes follow me. Pictures like that really creep me out.)
POGT316	I bet this makes the picture look spooky.
POGT317	I'd better get rid of this incriminating picture frame.
POGT318	I guess I'm better at this pirating thing than I thought! It worked!
POGT319	It's already unlocked.
POGT320	It's locked.
PONZ321	door
POGT322	It's one of the guest rooms.
POGT323	Uh, room service.
POGT324	Nobody's answering.
POGT325	I can't jimmy the door lock with that.
POGT326	Jamming cheese in the lock won't help.
POGT327	Pressing tofu in the lock won't help at all.
PONZ328	nail
POGT329	It's a heavy-duty picture-hanging nail.
POGT330	I can't use the nail with that.
POGT331	It's pointy.
POGT332	It's already about as magnetic as it's going to get.
POGT333	A magnetic nail. Neat.
POGT334	Completely worthless, but neat.
PONZ335	portrait
POGT336	This is one ugly picture. Looks just like the bartender.
POGT337	It's a Goodsoup family portrait, but I've cut out the face.
POGT338	`Baron C. Lambert Chowder-Goodsoup... 
POGT339	...Pioneer of Crouton Technology`
POGT340	He looks a lot like the guy at the bar.
POGT341	I don't think the portrait would look good there.
POGT342	All the hotel signs say I'm not supposed to touch the paintings.
POGT343	It's already got a big hole in it.
POGT344	I can't cut through it while it's in the frame.
PONZ345	portrait
PONZ346	door
POGT347	It's a door with a porthole in it, for that nautical accent.
POGT348	There's already a nail in the door.
PONZ349	portrait
POGT350	I kind of like it where it is.
POGT351	The face has been cut out.

POGT362	It looks out onto the cemetery.
POGT363	I'd rather leave it open. There's a peculiar odor in this hallway.

POGT365	Comfy.
POGT366	No time for that now. I've got a fiancée to rescue.

POGT368	It's Count Gazpacho Goodsoup, the cold-hearted canning magnate.

QSGT317	It's a bunch of conveniently-placed hollow reeds.
QSNZ318	quicksand
QSGT319	Of all the places for a quicksand pit.
QSGT320	If I don't get out of here quick I'm going to be eating all the quicksand I could ever want.
QSGT321	If I thrash around I'll only sink faster!
QSNZ322	reeds
QSGT323	They look pretty weak; I shouldn't have to cut them.

QSGT325	As if the quicksand weren't bad enough!
QSGT326	I can't use the reed with the entire plant.
QSGT327	It's already loaded.
QSNZ328	branch
QSGT329	It's a branch resting precariously on that tree root.
QSGT330	Even if I could hit the branch with that, it wouldn't do any good.
QSGT331	If only I had some way of dropping the weight on the branch from directly above.
QSNZ332	life-saving vine
QSGT333	If I could just reach that vine, I could pull myself free.

QSGT351	It's just floating there.
QSGT352	I'd better not put it away just yet. I think I'm on to something here.

QSGT354	I can't force enough air through this reed to move the balloon.

RGSO301	Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood!
RGSO302	I'm a mighty pirate.
RGSO303	What did you mean, `Ha`?
RGSO304	I'm mighty enough to defeat LeChuck! Twice!
RGSO305	So you're a ship captain, huh?
RGSO306	How'd you like to join my crew?
RGSO307	Why don't you want to join my crew?
RGSO308	Well, I didn't want you on my crew anyway.
RGSO309	Did you know you're starting to go gray?
RGSO310	Don't get me wrong. Gray hair suits you.
RGSO311	If I were you, I'd worry more about those split ends.
RGSO312	You've got a bald spot starting here in the back.
RGSO313	You seem irritable. Is it from your dry scalp?
RGSO314	They're doing great things with dandruff shampoo these days.
RGSO315	Fire! Run for your life!
RGSO316	Rabid dogs are on the loose! Get out now!
RGSO317	There's an ax-wielding maniac at the door! Flee!
RGSO318	The calls are coming from within the barber shop!
RGSO319	Storm's a-coming. Better get a move on.
RGSO320	Captain Rottingham? You're being paged.
RGSO321	You know, sitting down for too long can be unhealthy.
RGSO322	You seem busy. I'll come back later.
RGRH323	I see.
RGRH324	And I don't care.
RGRH325	HA!
RGRH326	I meant just what I said: HA!
RGRH327	If you're a mighty pirate, then I'm bald.
RGRH328	LeChuck? Ha!
RGRH329	Even if he is dead, there's just no excuse for that hair.
RGRH330	Not just any ship captain.
RGRH331	Don't tell me you've never heard of Captain René Rottingham.
RGGT332	I've never heard of Captain Rottingham.
RGRH333	I'm only the most cunning and well-groomed captain ever to sail the Caribbean.
RGRH334	Me? Serve on YOUR crew?
RGRH335	Please, don't make me break into hysterical laughter while this buffoon is working on my hair.
RGRH336	I serve under no man... or boy.
RGGT337	Now just one second...
RGRH338	If there's any treasure to be found, I'm going to be the man to find it.
RGRH339	And I'll look absolutely STUNNING while I'm doing it.
RGRH340	That's your loss.
RGRH341	And boy? Lose the pony-tail. It's so... last year.
RGRH342	I most certainly am not!
RGRH343	It doesn't... I mean... of course it would...
RGRH344	...but I don't have to worry about that for several years.
RGRH345	Split ends?
RGRH346	I'll have you know I've killed men for comments less slanderous than that.
RGRH347	What?!?
RGRH348	You're lying, of course.
RGGT349	If you say so.
RGGT350	All I know is that there's definitely some kind of shine going on back here.
RGRH351	My scalp is lovingly massaged with the finest creams and oils in the world, twice daily.
RGGT352	Eeeh. THAT's a little more than I wanted to know.
RGRH353	Your petty jabs and insults mean nothing to me.
RGRH354	I suggest you leave, boy...
RGRH355	...before you force me to defend my honor.
RGRH356	I'm sure the authorities probably have the situation under control.
RGRH357	But just in case, barber. More moisturizer!
RGRH358	I don't hear anything.
RGRH359	There are no rabid dogs on the loose.
RGGT360	That's just what they WANT you to think!
RGRH361	Perhaps you should offer yourself as a sacrifice so that the rest of us may be saved.
RGGT362	You must get out immediately!
RGRH363	I have no idea what you're talking about. Leave us alone.
RGGT364	Could be a twister.
RGRH365	Then I'm most definitely staying inside.
RGRH366	The humidity does horrible things to my hair.
RGRH367	Take a message.
RGGT368	It's a serious risk to your cardiovascular system.
RGGT369	I think a nice jog could be just what you need right about now.
RGGT370	Up and at 'em!
RGRH371	Go away.
RGRH372	That's a risk I'll just have to take.
RDGT301	No thanks. I'm on duty.

S9HM301	Captain?
S9GT302	Yes, Mr. McMutton?
S9HM303	We were wondering, we were...
S9HM304	...just what kind o' captain you are.
S9GT305	What do you mean, Haggis?
S9HM306	Well...
S9HM307	Some captains are men of action.
S9HM308	They like to have complete responsibility and control for their ship.
S9HM309	Other captains prefer to concentrate more on the thinking aspects of captaining.
S9HM310	The captain who's a man of action will undoubtedly have a much more difficult time...
S9HM311	...of defeating other scoundrels of the sea in the fast-paced realm of ship-to-ship combat.
S9HM312	The more academic captain will find the other pirate vessels he meets to be less aggressive...
S9HM313	...and therefore far easier and quicker to defeat in combat.
S9GT314	I see.
S9HM315	So, Captain Threepwood...
S9HM316	...which type of captain be ye?
S9SO317	I love a tough sea battle as much as the next captain!
S9SO318	I think that I'd rather let you guys help me out.
S9HM319	Challenging ship combat it is!
S9HM320	Easy ship combat it is!
S9VH322	A-sailin' out to sea.
S9BL323	When you hear our gentle singing...
S9HM324	You'll be sure to turn and flee!
S9GT325	Oh, this is just ridiculous.
S9BL326	We're a club of tuneful rovers!
S9HM327	We can sing in every clef!
S9VH328	We can even hit the high notes!
S9HM329	It's just too bad we're tone deaf!
S9VH330	We're thieving balladeers.
S9HM331	A gang of cutthroat mugs.
S9VH333	Just really good ear-plugs.
S9HM334	We'll fight you in the harbor.
S9BL335	We'll battle you on land.
S9VH336	But when you meet singing pirates...
S9GT337	They'll be more than you can stand.
S9BL338	Oh!
S9BL339	That was a good one!
S9GT340	No, it wasn't.
S9SO341	Come on, men! We've got to recover that map!
S9SO342	Let's go defeat that evil pirate!
S9SO343	All right, crew, let's get to work!
S9SO344	No time for song! We've got to move!
S9SO345	Less singing, more sailing.
S9SO346	I'm getting so sick of you guys and your rhyming.
S9SO347	Stop! Stop! Stop!
S9SO348	We'll surely avoid scurvy if we all eat an orange.
S9BL349	That pirate will be done for, when he falls into our trap!
S9VH350	We know he's sure to lose, 'cause we know where to fire at!
S9HM354	We're ready to set sail, though the cannons need a-priming.
S9BL355	The brass is what we'll polish and the deck is what we'll mop.
S9HM356	And...!
S9HM357	...um...
S9BL358	Well...
S9VH359	...err...
S9BL360	Door hinge?
S9VH361	No, no...
S9BL362	Guess the song's over, then.
S9HM363	Guess so.
S9VH364	Okay, back to work.

SPHM345	You can have it when you find me somethin' I can use to patch the ship!
SPGT346	I don't want to lubricate that.
SPGT347	I already have the lotion.
SPNZ348	Haggis McMutton
SPGT349	It's Haggis.
SPGT350	He's busy repairing the ship, now.
SPHM351	We already know our way back, thank ye.
SPNZ352	seawater
SPGT353	Those advertisements were no lie. It really is crystal clear.
SPGT354	I bet it's really salty.
SPGT355	I can't carry water in my hands.
SPNZ356	sticky tar substitute
SPGT357	It's Haggis' melted nacho cheese.
SPGT358	I still don't want to eat it.
SPGT359	It was enough work getting it here.
SIWM301	Even the bravest of men must dread the horror of this place.
SIWM302	Steel your courage boy! Now! Before you gaze upon the terrible, horrible face of...
SIWM303	...SKULL ISLAND!
SIGT304	That's a duck!
SIWM305	What are you talking about? Don't you see the skull?
SIGT306	This island doesn't look like a skull at all!
SIGT307	It looks like a great big, enormous duck! It should be called Duck Island!
SIWM308	Well, ya see...ya gotta squint and sorta turn your head and...
SIWM309	Ooooooooh! It's just SO scary!
SIGT310	If you squint and turn your head it looks like a bunny.
SIWM311	Well, anyway...see that light up there on the cliff face?
SIWM312	That's Smugglers' Cave.
SIWM313	It's run by King André, the greatest smuggler in the world...
SIWM314	...and his nefarious assistant, Cruff.
SIGT315	But how do I get up there?
SIWM316	You have to go to the top of the cliff.
SIGT317	Won't you be coming with me?
SIWM318	No. You must go alone.
SIWM319	There will be someone there who will help you.
SIWM320	But I warn you...beware of King André. He is as ruthless as he is bald.
SIWM321	Good luck.
SIGT322	Thanks.
SIGT323	I still say it looks like a duck.
SIGT324	Excuse me.
SISO325	I'd like to go back to Blood Island.
SISO326	Never mind.
SIWM327	Me too. This place gives me the creeps.
SIWM328	Okay.
SINZ329	cliff top
SINZ330	cliffside
SINZ331	Flying Welshman
SIGT332	I don't want to push him around.
SIGT333	It's the mysterious ferryman of Skull Island.
S8GT301	Excuse me...
S8SO302	Yo.
S8SO303	Hey.
S8SO304	Ahoy!
S8SO305	Buddy.
S8SO306	Pal.
S8SO307	I'm a dangerous pirate, who are you?
S8SO308	What's that putrid stench-ridden drivel that you're rehearsing?
S8SO309	Why can't you go back to the original scripts?
S8SO310	Can I watch you rehearse your horrible play?
S8SO311	PUH-LEEZE can I watch you rehearse?
S8SO312	C'mon. Let me watch you rehearse.
S8SO313	Can I join your show?
S8SO314	PUH-LEEZE can I join your show?
S8SO315	Acting is my life! Let me join your show!
S8SO316	Of course, what I really want to do is direct.
S8SO317	Have you been to Blood Island?
S8SO318	Who did you say knew about Blood Island?
S8SO319	Carry on.
S8SY320	Cromwell.
S8SY321	Slappy Cromwell.
S8SY322	It's not my real name, actually.
S8SY323	My agent told me my given name just didn't have star quality.
S8GT324	What was your given name?
S8SY325	Rex Fortune, Adventure Seeker.
S8GT326	I see.
S8SY327	Good heavens, no!
S8SY328	I could hear your awful singing in the barbershop from way over here.
S8SY329	And stop whining.
S8SY330	Let me be blunt...
S8SY331	You just don't have the hands of a spear carrier.
S8GT332	You have no idea how often I hear that.
S8GT333	I was a tree in my kindergarten play.
S8SY334	We ALREADY have a tree.
S8GT335	Oh.
S8SY336	Sorry, this is a one-man show.
S8US337	Hey! What am I? Chopped liver?
S8SY338	No, not liver. Liver has a more appealing stage presence.
S8SY339	Why?
S8GT340	I've always dreamed of my own production...'Titus Andronicus on Ice!'
S8SY341	Brilliant!
S8SY342	I'd rather you didn't.
S8SY343	I get nervous when people watch.
S8GT344	Of course.
S8SY345	And stop whining.
S8SY346	You might see the surprise ending to 'Romeo and Juliet.'
S8GT347	Romeo and Juliet die.
S8SY348	Actually, that ending didn't set well with the focus groups.
S8SY349	Then you'll hear all the answers to my knock-knock jokes.
S8SY350	But of course!
S8SY351	Blood Island was once THE place to be if you were an artist in the Caribbean.
S8SY352	Those were the days. We were young and wild! Pushing the limits of our craft.
S8SY353	Oh, what risky, daring performances we gave!
S8SY354	We weren't afraid to shock or offend the stodgy, mainstream sensibilities of our audiences.
S8GT355	Oh, what did you perform?
S8SY356	Dinner theater, mostly.
S8GT357	Could you tell me how I can find Blood Island?
S8SY358	My agent, Palido Domingo, always handled the travel arrangements.
S8SY359	He would know how to get there.
S8GT360	Any idea where I could find him?
S8SY361	He's a member of the Brimstone Beach Club here on Plunder Island.
S8SY362	You might catch him there.
S8SY363	My agent.
S8SY364	Most likely, he's at the Brimstone Beach Club.
S8SY365	But this...this is the masterwork of the bard!
S8SY366	Do you really think it's THAT bad?
S8SO367	Oh, it's THAT bad.
S8SO368	Do pirates drink grog?
S8SO369	Was the Great Pyramid of Cheops originally 481 feet high?
S8SO370	Bad like poi.
S8SY371	Oh, I knew I shouldn't have altered the material!
S8SY372	How could I have taken up my wretched pen and stabbed it, bodkin-like, through the unsullied poetry of the master.
S8GT373	You re-wrote Shakespeare?
S8SY374	I was compelled to! Not a single person was coming to any of my performances!
S8SY375	Oh, these stupid, brutish pirates! Not men enough to confront their own sensitive inner natures!
S8SY376	So I rewrote the whole folio! Contracted the brilliance of decades into a forty-five minute revue!
S8SY377	'SPEARE!
S8SY378	A theatrical medley.
S8SY379	Oh, the sweet, sweet, bitter irony of it all.
S8SY380	Now that you have confirmed that I have produced a work of irredeemable trash...
S8SY381	...I'm more or less guaranteed to have a financial success on my hands.
S8GT382	Why do I find that strangely encouraging?
SVGT301	Got what I needed from the smugglers.
SVWM302	Good. Let us leave this place of evil.
SVGT303	There's just one thing I need to do first.
SVWM304	Really? What's that?
SVLF305	Who's there?
SVLF306	Oh, It's just you.
SVLF307	Wait! What are you doing! Help! Help!!!!!!
SVLF308	WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
SVGT309	It's a massive diamond engagement ring.
SVGT310	I can't reach it.
SVGT311	Smuggling by candlelight. Very romantic.
SVKA312	Now, now, Mister Threepwood.
SVKA313	That would be... 
SVKA314	...stealing. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
SVGT315	Please stop laughing like that.
SVGT316	Two of spades, three of hearts, four of clubs, five of diamonds, eight of clubs, and king of diamonds.
SVGT317	What a terrible hand!
SVGT318	I've got a whole lot of nothing.
SVGT319	Two of spades, three of hearts... Hey, wait a second.
SVGT320	This is the exact same hand as I had last time! How is that even possible?
SVKA321	Ahhh. That's an interesting turn of... luck, Mister Threepwood.
SVKA322	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
SVGT323	Hmmm... 
SVGT324	I've got nothing. Something is fishy with this whole `game`.
SVGT325	These aren't even real playing cards! What game is this?
SVGT326	Oh, shoot. I got aces and eights. That's bad.
SVGT327	Hey! Neat! The Curse of Monkey Island Collectible Trading Card Game.
SVGT328	I got a Wally!
SVGT329	Another lousy hand. I think these guys might be cheating.
SVGT330	I've got a really terrible hand.
SVKA331	Apparently good fortune is not... in the cards for you.
SVKA332	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
SVGT333	I thought we agreed you weren't going to laugh like that anymore.
SVKA334	I have a full house, aces over kings. You lose.
SVGT335	Nothing, again.
SVGT336	This is exactly the same hand I had last time. How is that even possible?
SVKA337	That's an interesting turn of... luck, Mister Threepwood.
SVKA338	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
SVGT339	Hmmm... 
SVKA340	I have a royal flush. It seems as if you've lost again.
SVGT341	They aren't even using real playing cards anymore!
SVGT342	Mmmm. Let's see... 
SVGT343	...it looks like I've got an Orc Horde with thirty hit points... 
SVGT344	...and the Great Goddess Lomangorak of the Thirty Veils.
SVCR345	I've got the Sword of Azazel and Queen Masaputapah, Mistress of Darkness!
SVGT346	What game is this, anyway?
SVKA347	Poker, Mister Threepwood, and I win with a high straight.
SVGT348	Got any sixes?
SVCR349	Go fish.
SVKA350	As a matter of fact, I have four sixes.
SVKA351	I win again.
SVGT352	Hey! The Curse of Monkey Island Collectible Trading Card Game!
SVGT353	Okay, I've got a Wally... a Kenny... 
SVGT354	...and a pair of Lemonheads.
SVCR355	I've got a LeChuck and an Elaine.
SVKA356	Three-of-a-kind. I win.
SVGT357	I've got a whole bunch of nothing.
SVKA358	How unfortunate.
SVGT359	I've got a pair. The King of Diamonds, and... 
SVGT360	...the King of Insurance Salesmen.
SVKA361	Interesting, but I'm afraid you lose. I have three of a kind.
SVGT362	This is exactly the same hand I had last time. How is that even possible?
SVKA363	Ahhh. That's an interesting turn of... luck, Mister Threepwood.
SVKA364	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
SVGT365	Hmmm... 
SVGT366	Another pair of kings.
SVGT367	Well, I've got a pair. The King of Diamonds, and, err... 
SVGT368	...the King of Insurance Salesmen.
SVKA369	I have a royal flush. It seems you've lost again.
SVGT370	They aren't even using real playing cards anymore!
SVGT371	Well, I've got a squadron of demon-trolls, a High Priestess of Darkness... 
SVGT372	...and, uh, Stan, Lord High King of Life Insurance Needs.
SVCR373	I've got the Elven-Sword of Aragnarok and a horde of battle-gnomes!
SVGT374	What game is this, anyway?
SVKA375	Poker, Mister Threepwood, and I win with a high straight.
SVGT376	Got any insurance salesmen?
SVCR377	Go fish.
SVKA378	I have two pairs. I win again.
SVGT379	Hey, it's The Curse of Monkey Island Collectible Trading Card Game!
SVGT380	Okay, I've got a Wally... a Kenny... and a pair of Stans!
SVCR381	I've got a LeChuck and an Elaine.
SVKA382	I have three-of-a-kind. I win.
SVGT383	I've got a whole bunch of nothing, and a business card.
SVKA384	Oh, how unfortunate.
SVGT385	Uh, I've got an Ace of Death.
SVKA386	I have a pair. You lose, Mister Threepwood.
SVGT387	I have a pair of Deaths, uh, Ace high.
SVKA388	I have three-of-a-kind.
SVKA389	You lose again.
SVGT390	Three-of-a-kind! Death, death, death.
SVKA391	Hmmm... Interesting turn of luck, Mister Threepwood... 
SVKA392	But I have a full house. Aces and kings.
SVGT393	I've got four-of-a-kind.
SVGT394	Read 'em and weep!
SVKA395	That is an impressive hand, Mister Threepwood... 
SVKA396	...but not quite impressive enough.
SVKA397	I have four aces and a king.
SVCR398	And I have four kings and an ace.
SVGT399	Wait a second... that's not... 
SVKA400	Terrible run of luck you're having, eh, Guybrush?
SVGT401	Five of a kind.
SVGT402	Right there.
SVGT403	Not even you guys can beat five of a kind.
SVCR404	Grrr... 
SVKA405	You're correct, Mister Threepwood.
SVKA406	We cannot beat five of a kind.
SVKA407	The question remains, however, whether or not you can beat a pair.
SVGT408	A pair?
SVCR409	A pair of murderous smugglers!
SVGT410	Huh?
SVKA411	US, Mister Threepwood. I'm talking about US.
SVCR412	We're gonna to kill ya!
SVGT413	OHHHH... I get it.
SVGT414	`Whether or not you can beat a pair.` That's pretty clever.
SVKA415	I hope you're prepared to pay for that.
SVGT416	Never mind.
SVCR417	Hands off!
SVGT418	I was just looking.
SVKA419	That's very expensive, you know.
SVGT420	I'll bet! I'll just leave it where it is.
SVCR421	Look, but don't touch.
SVGT422	Gotcha.
SVKA423	Keep that door closed!
SVLF424	Sorry, I just wanted to make sure Mister Threepwood made it down all right.
SVLF425	I'm going to lunch, if anyone needs me.
SVKA426	Shut that door! There's a draft!
SVLF427	Does anyone know a good Thai restaurant in the area?
SVKA428	Don't open that door! You'll blow out the candles!
SVKA429	Stop opening that door!
SVLF430	Oh, sorry, I was just looking for the time cards.
SVLF431	Hey, what was the name of that story about those guys who try to blow up that bridge?
SVKA432	Go away! You're going to blow out the candles!
SVLF433	Does anyone have twenty pieces of eight I can borrow for the vending machine?
SVCR434	Beat it!
SVLF435	I'm kind of lonely. Does anyone want to talk?
SVKA436	No. Stop opening that door!
SVKA437	Get out! You'll blow out the candles!
SVGT438	It's a good thing I'm not afraid... of heights.
SVGT439	Oh, I don't feel so good.
SVKA440	As a matter of fact, a new shipment just arrived yesterday.
SVKA441	They're sure to be best-sellers. Here, take one.
SVGT442	Now, now, gentlemen... 
SVGT443	Let's not be too hasty.
SVLF444	There's a deliveryman out here with a package -- is it okay if I sign for it?
SVKA445	You idiot! You blew out the lights!
SVGT446	I got the diamond!
SVCR447	Not for long, you little... 
SVKA448	OUCH! Hit him, not me, you cretin!
SVCR449	Who are you calling a... OOOF!
SVKA450	There he goes! Get him!
SVNZ451	dangerous precipice
SVGT452	They should have a guard rail or something.
SVGT453	I can see my house from here!
SVNZ454	weak hand
SVGT455	I can't use this terrible hand with that.
SVGT456	No matter how I arrange them, they're still terrible.
SVNZ457	King André
SVGT458	Not exactly the kind of guy I expected to find living in a cave surrounded by heaping mounds of treasure.
SVGT459	I think he could take me.
SVGT460	I don't want to give away my ace in the hole!
SVGT461	I don't have enough tarot cards to make a full hand.
SVNZ462	Cruff
SVCR463	What are YOU looking at?
SVGT464	Uh, nothing. Sir.
SVGT465	I think that would be a very bad idea.
SVGT466	He's not much of a talker.
SVNZ467	chandelier
SVGT468	Not now. I'm in the middle of a game!
SVGT469	I can't get close enough to the candles to blow them out.
SVNZ470	enormous diamond
SVGT471	Wow! It's huge! And not a curse on it!
SVGT472	That's for Elaine and Elaine only.
SVGT473	What a rock!
SVGT474	They won't let me have the diamond.
SVNZ475	completed diamond ring
SVGT476	I'm determined to use this to propose to Elaine... again.
SVGT477	I'm going to guard this ring with my life.
SVNZ478	deadly sword
SVGT479	Cool! I may actually get to use a real weapon!
SVNZ480	treasure chest
SVGT481	Paydirt!
SVNZ482	Smuggle Bunny
SVGT483	It's adorable, and functional.
SVGT484	It's not THAT adorable.
SVNZ485	Smuggle Bunny crates
SVGT486	They're stacked like adorable, fluffy cordwood. Eerie.
SVGT487	There are so many of them, it ruins their chances of becoming collectible items.
SVNZ488	barrel o' treasure
SVGT489	Now there's a lot o' treasure!
SVNZ490	golden frame
SVGT491	It's a solid gold picture frame.
SVGT492	I don't have any pictures nice enough for a frame like that.
SVNZ493	crown
SVGT494	Regal.
SVNZ495	treasure chest
SVGT496	Chesty.
SVNZ497	treasure chest
SVGT498	I suppose when you have this much treasure, you need a lot of chests.
SVNZ499	expensive thing
SVGT500	I have no idea what that is, but it sure looks expensive.
SVNZ501	Smuggle Bunny crate
SVGT502	Even packed into confined spaces, they're still adorable.
SVGT503	There are plenty of people who could give them better homes than I ever could.
SVGT504	I wouldn't know what to say.
SVNZ505	Smuggle Bunny
SVGT506	There's nothing sadder than a lone Smuggle Bunny.
SVGT507	It's too adorable. I don't want to lose my dark, piratey edge.
SVGT508	I think he'd prefer to be alone right now.
SVNZ509	Smuggle Bunny
SVGT510	What could have driven that adorable Smuggle Bunny to seek refuge at the top of a chandelier?
SVGT511	I can't reach him.
SVGT512	I wonder if anyone can.
SVGT513	Don't jump! You've got so much to live for!
SVNZ514	Smuggle Bunny
SVGT515	He's guarding the treasure. Adorable.
SVNZ516	zombie pirate toy
SVGT517	He's so cute!
SVGT518	Aren't you the cutest little thing!
SVGT519	I can't do that from here!
SKGT301	That won't help me get out of this snake.
SKPN302	GULP...
SKPN303	...HACK...
SKPN304	... cough, cough ...
SKPN305	...HAACCKK...
SKPN306	...HAAAAAAACCCKK...
SKGT307	Whew!
SKGT308	That sure was a close one!
SKGT309	I thought for sure when I got eaten by that snake that I was done for!
SKGT310	Thank goodness I'm...
SKGT311	...safe...
SKGT312	...now...
SKGT313	Hey!
SKGT314	Hang on, the quicksand is sucking all the cool stuff I found in that snake from my pants.
SKGT315	Now THERE's an odd sensation.
SKGT316	Hmmm... I wonder what this sign means...
SKGT317	Snake crossing?
SKGT318	What possible harm could a snake...
SKGT319	Well, this isn't good.

SKGT327	I can't reach it!
SKGT328	Hey, this looks like an ipecac flower.
SKGT329	It makes syrup of ipecac. That seems logical.
SKGT330	I can't see what that is... 
SKGT331	...but I bet it's a box of Full-o-Bran cereal... 
SKGT332	...the highest fiber content available without a prescription.
SKGT333	Last I heard, they added even more live white mouse flavor!
SKGT334	I think it's a box of Full-o-Bran super high-fiber cereal.

SKGT338	I can't see it, but I bet it's Snake-Away brand snake repellent.

SKGT340	I think those are jaws of life, which would really help me get out of this snake.

SKGT346	I can't see it, but I'm sure it's a nine-iron.
SKNZ347	machete
SKGT348	I think it's a machete sharp enough to cut through even the largest reptiles.
SKNZ349	Faberge egg
SKGT350	It's a priceless, delicate Faberge egg.
SKGT351	It's priceless. I can't eat it.
SKGT352	I don't want to break it.
SKNZ353	reservation slip
SKGT354	It's a reservation slip for Blondebeard's Chicken.
SKGT355	I don't need reservations for that.
SKGT356	I might need these reservations later.
SKNZ357	breakfast
SKGT358	It's all part of a balanced breakfast. Pancakes, syrup, sausage, eggs, and a cup of coffee.
SKGT359	I'm too nervous to be hungry.
SKNZ360	pancake syrup
SKGT361	Mmmmm... Maple.
SKGT362	That's one of the few things that won't taste better with syrup.
SKGT363	Syrup? By itself?  Eeew.
SKGT364	Syrup? By itself? Eeew.
SKNZ365	pancakes
SKGT366	It's a stack of big, fluffy pancakes.
SKGT367	They've already been partially digested.
SKGT368	The pancakes have already been partially digested. Syrup won't help.
SKGT369	They're mostly digested, and I really don't enjoy handling them.
SKNZ370	sausage
SKGT371	Ooooh. Thick, fatty sausage patties!
SKGT372	No thanks. This is one pirate who's concerned about saturated fats.
SKNZ373	eggs
SKGT374	Two eggs, over easy.
SKGT375	They've already been partially digested.
SKGT376	They're mostly digested, and I really don't enjoy handling them.
SKNZ377	coffee
SKGT378	It's a big, steaming cup o' joe.
SKGT379	I'm nervous enough just being inside this snake.
SKGT380	Steaming hot coffee won't help on that.
SKNZ381	syrup of ipecac
SKGT382	It's syrup of ipecac, same as the kind used in hospitals.
SKGT383	I can't use syrup of ipecac with that.
SKGT384	I feel queasy enough just being inside this snake.
SKNZ385	naturalist remains
SKGT386	It's the remains of a member of the Plunder Island Naturalist Society.
SKGT387	Those guys sure are dedicated.
SKGT388	That's disgusting.
SKGT389	I doubt he has much to say.
SKNZ390	vacuum cleaner attachments
SKGT391	It's a complete array of vacuum cleaner attachments.
SKGT392	No vacuum.
SKNZ393	spare tire
SKGT394	It's got a tread that just grips the road and won't let go.
SKGT395	I don't have any use for it.
SKNZ396	encyclopedia
SKGT397	The encyclopedia won't help with that.
SKNZ398	old phone books
SKGT399	The Plunder Island Yellow Pages.
SKGT400	No phone.
SKNZ401	top-secret plans
SKGT402	I hate to think what would happen if these fell into the wrong hands.
SKGT403	These should only be used for good.
SKNZ404	stuffed Dinghy Dog
SKGT405	He's wearing a little shirt that says, `I Whooped It Up At Big Whoop.`
SKGT406	He's cuddly, but I really want out of this snake.
SKGT407	I think I'm a little old for that.
SKNZ408	snake head
SKGT409	It's the fearsome head of that pirate-eating snake.
SKGT410	I'd love to punch him one, but I don't want to make him angry.
SKGT411	I doubt he's in any mood to listen.
SKGT412	He's already eaten.
SKGT413	He's not going for the flower just by itself.

S7SO312	I'd like some paste on my snow cone, please.
S7SO313	A bit of this coffee would be lovely.
S7SO314	I think that tofu on my snow cone would be ideal.
S7SO315	How about some of this doggy hair?
S7SO316	I'd really like some of this meringue pie on it.
S7SO317	That's all that I'd like, thanks.

SDGT302	Oh no! It's LeChuck!
SDGT303	LeChuck's back again!
SDGT304	Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
SDGT305	Darn, here he comes!
SDGT306	You don't give up easily, do you?
SDGT307	Will you please stop!
SDGT308	Truce!
SDGT309	Can't we all just get along?
SDGT310	This is getting ridiculous!
SDGT311	Hey! Look! A nickel!
SDGT312	Cripes!
SDGT313	Don't you think there's enough pain and suffering in the world already?
SDGT314	Why can't you leave me alone?
SDGT315	I'm losing my patience with you, LeChuck.
SDGT316	You despicable monster!
SDGT317	Come on, I'm ready for you!
SDGT318	You're the ugliest monster ever created!
SDGT319	You know, by hurting me you only hurt yourself.
SDGT320	Look over there! A three-headed monkey!
SDGT321	Huh. Just smack me.
SDLC322	Aye, Threepwood!
SDLC323	It be me, yer worst nightmare.
SDLC324	You'll be sorry you ever set foot here on Monkey Island when I'm through with ya!
SDLC325	I'll be chasin' ya round this roller coaster 'till ye be my undead slave, Threepwood!
SDLC326	Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!  Argh!
SDLC327	Aye! And I'll keep a-comin' after ye for as long as it takes to make ye one of the undead!
SDLC328	I'll never give up!
SDLC329	And I have all eternity to hound ye!
SDLC330	I'll not stop until you've joined me and my bride-to-be as our undead doorman!
SDLC331	I'll give ya a truce, ya skinny-necked sea-sponge!
SDLC332	You'll get along nicely with my skeleton crew when I've finished with you!
SDLC333	Not as ridiculous as a worthless boy who thinks he can challenge the Demon Pirate LeChuck!
SDLC334	You won't fool me with that this time, Threepwood!
SDLC335	On toast!
SDLC336	Not in your world, Threepwood.
SDLC337	Perhaps if you had left Elaine and I alone I would!
SDLC338	Ah, but Threepwood, I've only just begun to beat you!
SDLC339	Yes, what's yer point?
SDLC340	That's the spirit!
SDLC341	Ta ha! You can't stave me off with that!
SDLC342	Except for the ones you've dated.
SDLC343	Not including Elaine, of course!
SDLC344	You're not making sense, Threepwood.
SDLC345	Now hold still while I incinerate yer gizzard.
SDLC346	Look, under your feet, the fires of Hell!
SDLC347	Coming right up.
SDGT348	Youch!
SDGT349	Ow!
SDGT350	Ow.
SDGT351	Too late for me to get out.

S5GT302	Hi, I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I...
S5GS303	Stop yelling!
S5GT304	I wasn't yelling, I was just...
S5GS305	I've got a terrible hangover.
S5GS306	Find something to clear my head and I can talk to you.
S5GS307	And keep it down!
S5GT308	What was that I...
S5GS309	SHHHHH!
S5GS310	Just get me the ingredients for a hangover remedy and I'll talk to you.
S5SO311	I'd like a drink, please.
S5SO312	I don't believe we've met. Who are you?
S5SO313	I thought if I died, I'd be buried with your aunt.
S5SO314	Uncle Griswold! It's me! Don't you recognize me?
S5SO315	Look at me! Don't I look just like a Goodsoup?
S5SO316	I could just talk about Goodsoup history all day.
S5SO317	Hypothetically, how would one get into your aunt's tomb?
S5SO318	Again, how would one get into your kindly aunt's tomb?
S5SO319	What do you know about the lost ring of Blood Island?
S5SO320	Tell me that whole ring story again.
S5SO321	Where did you say the Goodsoup family diamond was?
S5SO322	How can I get out to Skull Island?
S5SO323	The volcano has erupted!
S5SO324	This place sure is dead!
S5SO325	How's business?
S5SO326	I'm off to explore the rustic charms of Blood Island.
S5GS327	Oh! It's just wonderful!
S5GS328	Now that the volcano is erupting again, the reservations are just pouring in!
S5GS329	Soon every room in the hotel will be filled.
S5GS330	All except... for that one room.
S5GS331	The room with the guest... that never left!
S5GT332	Is this going to be scary? Because I warn you...
S5GS333	Every night we heard strange noises coming from his room...
S5GS334	Frightful crashing sounds that shook the entire hotel, each followed by the most horrible screaming and cursing.
S5GS335	Then, one night, the sounds just stopped...
S5GS336	...but were replaced with a terrifying wailing and moaning.
S5GS337	I had the room sealed and vowed never to enter that hateful place again.
S5GS338	Except, of course... for that one room.
S5GT339	Would you let me into that room?
S5GS340	No!
S5GS341	That room must remain locked and undisturbed forever!
S5GS342	I suppose you would have to die.
S5GT343	Oh, crud.
S5GS344	Well, isn't it obvious?
S5GS345	You can't be buried in the Goodsoup family crypt...
S5GS346	...unless you're a member of the Goodsoup family.
S5GT347	A member of the family, eh?
S5NN348	Goodsoup
S5GS349	I am Griswold, last of the Goodsoups and proprietor of this hotel.
S5GS350	You may have heard of us and our soup restaurant - resort empire that stretches across the Caribbean.
S5GT351	...Well...
S5GS352	This was once our proudest resort.
S5GS353	In recent years, however, hard times have befallen the Family Goodsoup...
S5GS354	...and left me alone in this rotting hotel.
S5GS355	`The Goodsoup Plantation Resort Hotel and Casino`
S5GS356	But it lost all its popularity after the regular eruptions of Mt. Acidophilus stopped.
S5GT357	The volcano has erupted!
S5GS358	Sure.
S5GS359	What will you have?
S5SO360	I'd like something subtle, with a hint of oak.
S5SO361	Give me something to put hair on my chest.
S5SO362	Whatever. Nothing's too strong for a pirate like me.
S5SO363	Give me something to clear my sinuses.
S5SO364	Grog. Straight up.
S5SO365	I'll take a drink that simply reeks of sophistication.
S5SO366	Bring me a grog!
S5SO367	Give me a big, fruity drink with an umbrella in it.
S5NN368	Ol' Peg-rot Single-Malt Whiskey
S5GS369	Right.
S5NN370	Grog 'n' Menthol
S5GS371	One grog and menthol.
S5GS372	Coming right up.
S5NN373	The Open Sore
S5GS374	I've got a drink that simply reeks.
S5GS375	Take it or leave it.
S5GT376	I'll take it.
S5NN377	Caribbean Body Slam
S5GS378	Good choice!
S5GS379	It's a delicious taste of the islands.

S5GT391	Hey! Don't I get one of those decorative umbrellas to go in my tropical drink?
S5GS392	Uhhh...
S5GS393	I don't think we have any...
S5GS394	No, I'm wrong.
S5GS395	I DO have this one.
S5GS396	Ah, that's a very sad chapter in my family's history.
S5GS397	My great aunt Minnie `Stronie` Goodsoup was a well-to-do member of Blood Island society.
S5GS398	Her one weakness was her romantic nature.
S5GS399	She had a thing for pirates, one in particular.
S5GS400	He came into port, she fell instantly in love, and they were engaged within the week.
S5GS401	Then, on the eve of their wedding...
S5GS402	...he stole the fantastic Goodsoup Diamond from her ring and sold it to smugglers on Skull Island.
S5GS403	She wore the empty engagement band on her finger until the day she died, which was not long after.
S5GS404	Some say she still haunts the Goodsoup family tomb.
S5GS405	It is a sad story, is it not?
S5GT406	Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.  Could you repeat that?
S5GS407	Get lost, chowderhead.
S5GS408	My dead great-aunt's fiancé stole the diamond and sold it to smugglers on Skull Island.
S5GS409	She wore the engagement band until the day she died...
S5GS410	...and she remains buried in the Goodsoup family crypt, dead of a broken heart.
S5GS411	That no-good pirate sold it to some smugglers on Skull Island.
S5GS412	They probably still have it.
S5GS413	Recognize you? I've never seen you before in my life!
S5GS414	What is your name?
S5SO415	Hearty Beef 'n' Potato.
S5SO416	Vegetable.
S5SO417	Split Pea with Ham.
S5SO418	Wonton.
S5GS419	Hearty Beef 'n' Potato?
S5GT420	I come from good Irish stock.
S5GS421	Vegetable?
S5GT422	I'm from California.
S5GS423	Split Pea with Ham?
S5GT424	Actually, my name is P. Hamilton Goodsoup.
S5GT425	`Split` is just a nickname.
S5GS426	Wonton?
S5GT427	I spent several years in the Orient.
S5GS428	Hmmm. I don't recall having any relatives with that name.
S5GS429	No, you don't look much like a Goodsoup at all.
S5GS430	In fact, you look more like one of the Brothschilds.
S5GS431	They always did have weak features.
S5GT432	Are you sure?
S5GS433	Of course I'm sure! Every day, I wander the Goodsoup family hall of portraits...
S5GS434	...and give my respects to each of my distinguished ancestors.
S5GS435	Every distinguishing feature of the Goodsoup family is there in those pictures.
S5GS436	And I see nothing in any of those portraits that might remind me of you.
S5GS437	No, I still don't think you have those noble Goodsoup features.
S5GS438	If you looked at all like a Goodsoup, I might believe your story.
S5GS439	Now that you mention it...
S5GS440	...you do bear a slight resemblance to my great-grandfather C. Lambert Goodsoup.
S5GT441	Clammy? Why, folks back home used to tell me all the time...
S5GT442	`You're the spitting image of Old Chowder Goodsoup!`
S5GS443	You know, I think you're right.
S5GS444	Ah, I wonder why I didn't see it before.
S5GS445	Well, this is a wonderful chance for us to catch up on old times!  What?  Hm.
S5GS446	Remember when our family first sailed onto Blood Island?
S5GT447	Do I? I still get goose bumps at the thought of it!
S5GS448	Ah, yes. When was that again?
S5GT449	Uh...
S5GT450	...fourteen...
S5GT451	...eigh--sevent--thirty...
S5GT452	...three?
S5GS453	1433?
S5GT454	Two?
S5GS455	No.
S5GS456	Hmph! I can't believe someone of the Goodsoup bloodline could be so ignorant of our family's heritage.
S5GS457	I'm still not convinced.
S5GS458	Every Goodsoup is well-read on our noble family history.
S5GS459	If you knew anything about our family, I might believe you.
S5GS460	How about that first fateful journey made to the Caribbean?
S5GT461	Oh, you mean the one that...
S5GT462	...Baron Salmon Bisque de Goodsoup began in 1621?
S5GS463	Exactly. He landed on Scabb Island with just a spoon and a dream.
S5GS464	In just four short years, he had formed the largest chain of all-soup restaurants in the western hemisphere!
S5GS465	By 1635, he had driven the entire VanSalad family out of the Caribbean...
S5GS466	...and had a restaurant empire that spanned the globe!
S5GT467	Actually, the VanSalads were not driven out until 1637...
S5GT468	...and the Goodsoup chain of restaurants and resorts never did become popular in the South Pacific.
S5GS469	Yeah. Uh, uh, uh. Alright. Whatever. Hmmm.
S5GS470	Well, there used to be a regular ferry out to Skull Island.
S5GT471	Used to?
S5GS472	Ah, one cold night, so the tale goes, the Welshman set out in his dinghy.
S5GS473	The deep fog around Skull Isle obscured even the moon...
S5GS474	...but the Welshman could see the distant light of the Blood Island lighthouse.
S5GS475	When he had rowed half the distance, the light in the lighthouse was mysteriously smashed...
S5GS476	...and the poor Welshman was lost, almost never to be seen again.
S5GT477	Almost?
S5GS478	Well, there are those who say, that late at night...
S5GS479	...if you stare into the fog long enough...
S5GS480	...you may see the Flying Welshman...
S5GS481	...rowing in his ghostly dinghy, lost for all eternity.
S5GT482	Creepy.
S5GS483	The only man who could take you to Blood Island was the old Welshman.
S5GS484	But he was lost at sea when the lighthouse broke.
S5GS485	He never was a very strong navigator.
S5GS486	Oh, I need another drink.
S5GT487	Not good, I take it.
S5GS488	Just look around -- no guests, no food, no entertainment, not even the cannibals will come here.
S5GS489	My only regular is a spooky old fortune-teller who gives everyone the creeps.
S5GS490	Err, no offense, Madame Xima.
S5XM491	A pox on your first-born.
S5GS492	Hmm. Yes, right.
S5GS493	Tell me about it. No guests, no food, no entertainment...
S5GS494	...if I weren't so insanely wealthy, I might get worried.
S5SO495	Why don't you try to liven the place up a little?
S5SO496	What was the story on that barbecue again?
S5SO497	What happened to all the guests?
S5SO498	Would you let me into the guest room upstairs?
S5SO499	Maybe if you tried a more aggressive marketing scheme...
S5SO500	Maybe if you booked some more entertainers...
S5SO501	Maybe if you focused on Blood Island's rich history...
S5SO502	Maybe you should get out of the hotel business.
S5SO503	Eh, that's a shame. I'm sorry I brought it up.
S5GS504	Well, that's quite a story.
S5GS505	Years ago, this hotel was one of the hottest destinations in the Caribbean.
S5GS506	People came from around the globe to see our world-famous dinner show.
S5GS507	You may have noticed the oddly-shaped barbecue out on the patio.
S5GT508	Yes, I did notice that.
S5GT509	Well, no...
S5GS510	Well, that barbecue was the centerpiece of our nightly entertainment.
S5GT511	Isn't a barbecue the central attraction of most sophisticated nightlife activities?
S5GS512	Maybe, but no one else had a barbecue like this one.
S5GS513	Every night the guests would gather around on the patio, and at precisely 6 o'clock...
S5SO514	You'd break out the charcoal lighter fluid?
S5SO515	You'd recite original poetry?
S5SO516	You'd make chewy, delicious s'mores?
S5SO517	You'd light up a senses-shattering fireworks extravaganza?
S5GS518	...no! Do you want to hear the story or not?
S5GT519	I'm sorry, I'm fascinated. Please go on.
S5GS520	Well, every night at precisely 6 o'clock the volcano would erupt...
S5GS521	...and the lava would flow down the side of the mountain and into the special trough that runs beneath the barbecue.
S5GS522	The guests absolutely loved it!
S5SO523	That's it? A barbecue? That's entertainment?
S5SO524	Isn't that some kind of fire hazard?
S5SO525	So what put an end to the magic?
S5SO526	Sounds groovy. I'll let you get back to work.
S5GS527	Well, I used to entertain in the bar...
S5GT528	You had a lounge act?
S5GS529	Yes, I played the piano...
S5GS530	...and we had keno.
S5GS531	Well, we'd get a case of severe third-degree burns every now and then...
S5GS532	...but everybody agreed that it was worth it. That volcano was a show-stopper!
S5GS533	One day, the volcano just inexplicably stopped erupting.
S5GS534	Without our main attraction, the resort just lost its appeal.
S5GS535	We've gone downhill ever since, and the volcano hasn't erupted to this day.
S5GT536	Tragic.
S5GS537	It's very unique.
S5GS538	When Mt. Acidophilus would erupt, lava would flow beneath the barbecue...
S5GS539	...and cook whatever we had on the grill.
S5GS540	(sigh)  If only the volcano were active again...
S5GS541	After the place started to run down, they all checked out.
S5GS542	All except... for one. The guest... that never left!
S5GT543	Is this going to be scary? Because I warn you...
S5GS544	Every night we heard strange noises coming from his room...
S5GS545	Frightful crashing sounds that shook the entire hotel, each followed by the most horrible screaming and cursing.
S5GS546	Then, one night, the sounds just stopped...
S5GS547	...but were replaced with a terrifying wailing and moaning.
S5GS548	I had the room sealed and vowed never to enter that hateful place again.
S5GS549	No! It is locked for a reason!
S5GS550	Let no man disturb the dark spirits who occupy that room.
S5GS551	I've tried everything!
S5GS552	Pamphlets, stickers, extensive print campaigns...
S5GS553	I even tried passing out vials of my own blood imprinted with the slogan...
S5GS554	`My parents went to Blood Island and all I got was this lousy plasma sample`
S5GT555	That's just gross.
S5GS556	Well, with the benefit of hindsight, I suppose it is.
S5GS557	I booked a juggling act here a while back, but that didn't work out.
S5GS558	Rather a moody guy. Kept talking about suffering for his art and all that.
S5GS559	The guests hated him. They actually cheered when he burst into flame during his firewalking act.
S5GS560	What history?
S5GS561	The island has a windmill and a lighthouse. There's not a whole lot to see.
S5GS562	Goodsoups have always been in hotel management.
S5GS563	I've got to do my part to keep the dream alive, booking rooms and mixing drinks.
S5GT564	That's stirring.
S5GS565	Excuse me, stirring drinks.
S5GT566	No, I meant... never mind.
S5GS567	Yes I know! The Goodsoup Empire is saved!
S5GS568	Ah! This is the happiest day of my life...
S5GS569	...next to the day Grandpa invented the stay-crispy-in-soup oyster cracker.
S5GT570	Well, I'm happy for ya.
S5GS571	Soon the resort will be flooded with tourists coming to see the volcano...
S5GS572	...and I can finally put on the show I was working on the last time we had guests.
S5GT573	What show is that?
S5GS574	'Voulez Vous Vichyssoise,' a dramatic musical about a talented, young, Parisian soup chef..
S5GS575	...who is cruelly taken down by the Paris culinary establishment...
S5GS576	...for her revolutionary ideas about soup preparation.
S5GT577	I'm sure it will be a big hit.
SLGT301	That's it! That must be where Elaine is buried!
SLGT302	It smells like something's burning...
SLGT303	Hmph...must be this shoddy seventeenth-century electrical wiring.
SLGT304	Wait a second... somebody's been monkeying around with these controls!
SLGT305	I'll need to read the instructions before they'll work.

SLGT307	It's the control panel for the spotlights.

SGSY329	Out!
SGSY330	Out, damned Spot!
SGSY331	But enough heady drama.
SGSY332	Now I'll do some plate spinning!
SGSY334	Then...
SGSY335	At this point...
SGSY336	Soon afterward...
SGSY337	There came a time...
SGSY338	In that time, long ago...
SGSY339	Is this a dagger I see before me?
SGSY340	No, it's three!
SGSY341	See how I juggle these knives... 
SGSY342	 ...at great personal risk to myself... 
SGSY343	 ...and to you if I slip!
SGSY344	Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him...
SGSY345	And his two pals!
SGMR346	Wheeeeee!
SGSY347	And now!
SGSY348	The moment I know you've all been waiting for!
SGSY349	How about some amazing... 
SGSY350	 ...Juggling!
SGGT351	Uh-oh! It looks like he's coming for the cannon balls now!
SGSY352	And now...the ultimate Shakespearean delight!
SGSY353	The famous `Cannonball Juggling` scene from `Romeo and Juliet.`
SGSY354	Whoa!
SGSY355	WHOOPS!
SGSY356	Eeeeeaaaaaaah!
SGSY357	'Ta swab, or not t'swab...'
SGSY358	No, no...That's not right.
SGSY359	C'mon, Slappy! You've got to get this right. The show opens today!
SGSY360	Then I kill Caesar...follow that up with a little soft shoe.
SGSY361	I don't remember. Is the water ballet before or after my mad scene?
SGSY362	'A pirate, by any other name, would still reek! Aargh!'
SGSY363	Next I burn Thebes, subdue its army, trample its citizenry...
SGSY364	 ...and then I smash the watermelon.
SGSY365	'What fools these men with morals be.'
SGSY366	Oh! I'm never going to be ready for this performance.
SGSY367	Oh, yeah. That whole 'lend me your ears' bit.
SGSY368	I sure hope I can get someone to actually do it.
SGSY369	Act IV, scene 8. 'Join me, Rosencrantz! I am your FATHER!'
SGSY370	 ...and then I do some prop comedy.
SGSY371	I'll teach these pirates what REAL culture is.
SGSY372	'You blocks, you stones, you very old meat, you worse than unlaundered things!'
SGSY373	'There are more things growing on the food in your galley, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'
SGSY374	Then I will release the ravenous panther which will eat Stu.
SGUS375	Hey!
SGSY376	Stu! If you're going to be an actor you've got to suffer for your art.
SGUS377	Oh, O.K.
SGSY378	We may have to lose that part anyway.
SGSY379	It's cutting into my monologue.
SGSY380	'The quality of grog be unstrained.'
SGSY381	'Oh, Juliet'...yadayadayada...
SGSY382	And then...
SGSY383	Umhmmmm...
SGSY384	'Oh, Romeo'...yadayadayada...
SGSY385	...mutter mutter mutter...
SGSY386	...mumble...
SGSY387	...next we'll...
SGSY388	...following which...mumble mumble mutter...
SGSY389	...Hmmmm...
SGSY390	...in the next scene, I...
SGSY391	...mutter...mumble...mutter...

SGSY394	IT'S EL POLLO DIABLO!

SGSY469	Thespian!
SGNN470	thespian
SGGT471	I don't want to touch him. He's covered in flop-sweat.
SGSY472	No thank you, sir. Chewing gum affects my diction.
SGSY473	No! My lunch, it shall not be lost!
SGNZ474	x-marks-the-spot
SGGT475	It's the hole that I dug Elaine up from.
SGGT476	Elaine must be buried underneath the stage!
SGGT477	I already got Elaine.
SGGT478	I can't dig it up with my bare hands!
SGGT479	Elaine! Are ya there?
SGGT480	There's no one in the hole.
SGNZ481	shovel
SGGT482	It's a prop shovel.
SGNZ483	missing floorboard
SGGT484	It's a hole where there used to be a floorboard.
SGGT485	There's nothing there to pick up.
SGGT486	Hello down there!
SGNZ487	missing floorboard
SGNZ488	missing floorboard

SGGT494	It's too big to carry.
SGNZ495	prop tree
SGNZ496	balcony
SGGT497	It's Juliet's balcony.
SGGT498	Wherefore would I put it?
SGNZ499	plank
SGGT500	I guess they changed the end of Romeo and Juliet.
SGGT501	I don't need a plank to walk.
SGNZ502	headstone
SGGT503	It's Yorick's headstone from Hamlet.
SGGT504	I can't use a papier-mâché headstone.
SGGT505	I think I'll let him rest in peace.
SGNZ506	hideous pirate
SGGT507	That is just disturbing.
SGGT508	I don't think he's interested.
SGGT509	So how'd you get roped into doing this show?
SGUS510	I'm a spokesmodel, actually.
SGUS511	But what I really want to do is act.
SGUS512	People just don't take you seriously when you're a spokesmodel.
SGGT513	How surprising.
SGUS514	Yeah. Isn't it?
SGGT515	Break a peg-leg.
SGUS516	Thanks.
SGGT517	I think I'll let him study his lines.
SGSQ518	You're no actor! Get off the stage, ya bum!
SGSY519	What!?
SGUS520	But I didn't...
SGSY521	Just you be quiet and help me rehearse!
SGUS522	None for me, thanks.
SGNZ523	plaque
SCGT301	Now THESE are high-grade nails.
SCGT302	They're already as magnetic as a bunch of coffin nails can ever be.
SCGT303	Well, that was a completely pointless exercise.
SCGT304	I don't want to use the coffin nails with that.
SCGT305	They're pointy.
SCGA306	...so then the undertaker says,
SCGA307	`I wanted to be a pallbearer, but I couldn't stop coffin!`
SCGS308	Ha ha! You crack me up, Mort.
SCGA309	So what's with the new guy?
SCGS310	Ah, he's been like that for an hour now. Passed out cold.
SCGS311	He'll come around.
SCGA312	I don't know... I'm pretty sure he's dead.
SCGS313	Hmmm. I guess that's the end of the game, then.
SCGA314	What with him being the main character and all.
SCGA315	Funny, I didn't think you could die in LucasArts adventure games.
SCGS316	Maybe they're trying something different.
SCGA317	Want I should take care of him?
SCGS318	Would you? It's bad for business, having him just lie there.
SCGA319	This guy's dead again?
SCGS320	Nah, he's just faking it.
SCGA321	No, I'm pretty sure it's the real thing this time.
SCGS322	Oh. If you say so... He's an awfully fragile little fellow, isn't he?
SCGA323	I'll take care of 'im.
SCGA324	Rest in peace, and all that.
SCGA325	Hi, Stan.
SCGT326	Hey!
SCGT327	I'm not really dead!
SCGT328	Oh come on, cut it out!

SCSA365	Well, hello! What a surprise, your dropping in like this!
SCSA366	Now you see? This is exactly what I was talking about.
SCSA367	Welcome back to `Mutual of Stan!`
SCSA368	Perhaps I can interest you in some life insurance.
SCGT369	Yikes!
SCGT370	Where is that tell-tale pounding coming from?
SCGT371	It's coming from within one of these coffins... 
SCGT372	...from the dead... 
SCGT373	...the dead that surround me... 
SCGT374	They must know my horrible secret!
SCGT375	They will never let me rest until I've paid for the wrongs I've committed against...
SCGT376	Wait a second. I don't HAVE a horrible secret.
SCSA377	Whew! I'm glad to finally be out of that thing!
SCSA378	(Even though it was a spacious, comfortable model with plenty of leg and head room.)
SCSA379	Well, hello there! Say, you look familiar... 
SCGT380	Uh, yes, well... 
SCSA381	Of course! Guybrush Threepwood!
SCSA382	You're the one who locked me in there in the first place!
SCGT383	Well, you see, I've been meaning to... 
SCSA384	No, no! I won't hear of it!
SCSA385	That was the best time of my life! Gave me plenty of time to think, you know.
SCSA386	To think about the things that really matter.
SCSA387	I don't know if you've considered this, son... 
SCSA388	...but live burials are not an altogether uncommon experience here in the Caribbean.
SCGT389	I wasn't aware of that.
SCSA390	Not to mention pirate raids and deadly sea battles... 
SCSA391	...huge, man-eating reptiles... 
SCSA392	...dangerous quicksand pits... 
SCSA393	...trigger-happy duelists... 
SCSA394	...and, of course, those pesky undead.
SCSA395	Have you ever thought of what would happen to your loved ones should this gruesome fate befall you?
SCGT396	Well, no, but, but.. 
SCSA397	Well, of course you have plenty of time to think about it.
SCSA398	OR DO YOU?
SCSA399	I'm one of the lucky ones. I've been dead.
SCSA400	It's given me a whole new perspective on life!
SCSA401	A life that I'm going to devote to making sure people's life insurance needs are met.
SCSA402	Here. Take one of my business cards I've had made up.
SCGT403	If you've been locked in that coffin, how were you able to have business cards made?
SCSA404	Now's not the time to worry about the technicalities, son.
SCSA405	Now's the time to ask yourself:
SCSA406	Are you covered?
SCSA407	Run along now, and let me set up my office.  Hmm?
SCGT408	We're trapped in here! The door's locked!
SCSA409	Nonsense! This is one of Stan's Kozy Krypts, all equipped with a patented Secure-Lok Release Mechanism.
SCSA410	Just jiggle the handle there.
SCGT411	Some things are better left nailed shut.
SCGT412	The pounding isn't coming from in there.
SCGT413	It sure is dark.
SCGT414	Ooooh.  Spooky.
SCGT415	It won't open! I'm trapped!
SCGT416	No thanks. I don't want any more to do with it.
SCGT417	It's already open.
SCGT418	Help!
SCGT419	Open Sesame!
SCGT420	Darn!
SCGT421	I think that knocking is coming from inside this coffin!
SCGT422	It's creepy.
SCGT423	I can't open it.
SCGT424	It's too heavy for me to carry.
SCGT425	I've already opened it.
SCGT426	Go into the light!
SCGT427	The spirits have left it.
SCGT428	It's empty, I don't need to seal it shut.
SCGT429	I wonder where the spider that spun that web is?
SCGT430	There's no spider there.
SCGT431	I'm afraid it would stick to my hands.
SCGT432	Creepy skull.
SCGT433	I don't want to carry around any skulls I don't know.

SCNZ443	insurance money
SCGT444	This is a lot of money!

S6SO301	You've convinced me. I want to buy some insurance.
S6SO302	I need coverage!
S6SO303	Never mind.
S6GT304	I think I need coverage right now!
S6SA305	Now hold on just a minute there, son.
S6SA306	Give me a chance to get the office set up.
S6SA307	Run along, now!
S6SA308	A wise choice, and one you won't soon regret.
S6SA309	The question isn't whether or not you can afford to buy an insurance policy... 
S6SA310	It's whether you can afford NOT to.
S6SA311	Speaking of which, CAN you afford to buy an insurance policy?
S6GT312	Well... how much does it cost?
S6SA313	Oh, that depends on a variety of factors: how much coverage you need... 
S6SA314	...how much you're willing to spend... 
S6SA315	...all sorts of highly complicated, sliding-scale insurance equations and such.
S6SA316	But I won't bore you with all that. Let me just ask you this:
S6SA317	How much money do you have?
S6GT318	Well, I've got these wooden nickels!
S6SA319	I see.
S6SA320	Maybe I've confused you somewhere along the line.
S6SA321	While nothing would please me more to send you out of here... 
S6SA322	...with the peace of mind that your family will be provided for in the unlikely event of your death... 
S6SA323	I have to run a business here.
S6SA324	If you can't at least show me some collateral, I can't give you a policy.
S6SA325	That's what I've been telling you all along!
S6SA326	What were you planning on offering as collateral?
S6SO327	How about an enormous, uncursed diamond?
S6GC328	This antique bottle... 
S6GC329	This one-of-a-kind refrigerator magnet... 
S6GC330	These coffin nails...

S6SO341	I don't have anything you would appreciate. Never mind.
S6GT342	This antique, hand-crafted bottle of rich, creamy shaving soap.
S6GT343	The closest, most comfortable shave possible!

S6GT345	Very collectable.
S6GT346	Coffin nails. All shapes and sizes.
S6GT347	Hardly ever used.
S6GT348	This fine cane-handled umbrella.
S6GT349	Makes a great gift!

S6GT352	This high-precision compass.
S6GT353	Because we all need a little direction in our lives.
S6GT354	Doggy treats.
S6GT355	They fight tartar while promoting a healthy, shiny coat.
S6GT356	An assortment of tarot cards.
S6GT357	Practice the mystic art of fortune-telling at home or on vacation!

S6GT359	Includes lid, at no extra cost to you.
S6GT360	A genuine, high-quality, die-cast stainless steel crowbar.
S6GT361	Great for those embarrassing live burials.
S6GT362	This rare, first-edition volume of the Goodsoup family history.
S6GT363	Very valuable, very educational.
S6GT364	This highly-accurate map to Blood Island!
S6GT365	I absolutely guarantee you won't find another one just like it.
S6GT366	This authentic pirate relic.
S6GT367	A genuine tooth from an actual pirate!
S6GT368	Only one of its kind.
S6SA369	How about that?
S6SA370	Do you HAVE an enormous, uncursed diamond?
S6GT371	Okay, no... 
S6GT372	...but I'm, like, this close to getting one.
S6SA373	Well, I'm this close to believing that you're trying to take advantage of my generosity.
S6SA374	Maybe you'd like to make me a serious offer.  Hmmm?
S6SA375	Is that real gold?
S6GT376	The finest known to man.
S6GT377	Not much spit on it, either, anymore.
S6SA378	Now you're starting to speak my language.
S6SA379	No.
S6SA380	Not interested.
S6SA381	I don't think so.
S6SA382	Surely you're joking.
S6SA383	All right! Let's find a coverage plan that suits your needs.
S6SA384	And you can rest assured that you've provided for your family well after your unfortunate departure.
S6GT385	What are the terms of this plan, exactly?
S6SA386	It's quite simple, son.
S6SA387	When you die, whoever holds that policy gets a lot of money.
S6GT388	A lot of money! Wow!
S6SA389	`Wow!` is right!
S6SA390	Now, I want you to be careful out there.
S6GT391	Okay, I will. Thanks!
S6SA392	No, I'm serious.
S6SA393	I want you to be very, very careful.
S6GT394	Will do!
S6SA395	Now hold on just a minute there, son.
S6SA396	Give me a chance to get the office set up.
S6GT397	I'm cashing in this insurance policy.
S6GT398	Give me a lot of money.
S6SA399	But this is a LIFE insurance policy.
S6SA400	You collect when the policy holder dies.
S6GT401	No, honest! I WAS dead for a really long time!
S6SA402	And you just `got better?`
S6GT403	Well, yes.
S6SA404	Do you have any proof of this miracle?
S6GT405	I'm dead. I really am.
S6SA406	Do you have any proof that you're dead?
S6GT407	As a matter of fact, smart guy... 
S6GT408	...no.
S6SA409	Then it appears that you're just wasting my time.
S6SA410	Run along and play, now. I'm trying to run a business here.
S6GT411	I've got your proof right here!
S6GT412	A death certificate!
S6SA413	Well, this must be some kind of mistake.
S6GT414	Uh-uh. It's right there, in hi-res black-and-white.
S6GT415	I died. Give me a lot of money.
S6SA416	Hmmm... It looks like I'm left with no choice but to acquiesce.
S6GT417	No! Just give me my money!
S6SA418	That's what I mean.
S6GT419	Oh. Thanks.
S6GT420	Excuse me, but...
S6SA421	Sorry, son, no time to chat.
S6SA422	Every second I spend talking to you is a second taken away from my loyal customers!
S6GT423	So I'm not a loyal customer?
S6SA424	Frankly, no. You're a bit of a high risk.
S6GT425	High risk? I'm young, don't smoke...
S6GT426	...and I run away screaming from any sort of life-threatening situation.
S6SA427	And yet you still have this tendency to die and then reanimate and take my money.
S6GT428	Well, there IS that...
S6GT429	I don't think he wants to talk to me anymore.

TWGT462	Hey! There's no bottom to this mug!
TWGT463	I can't drink from that mug because there's a big hole in the bottom.

TRGT028	I'll leave it here and come back for it when I have a boat.
TRGT301	I've finally found my treasure!
TRGT302	I'm a REAL pirate after all!
TRGT303	Look at all this!
TRGT304	And it's mine! All mine!
TRGT305	Gold!
TRGT306	And jewels!
TRGT307	I'm rich!
TRGT308	And still...
TRGT309	I would give it all up for the love of Elaine.
TRGT310	I think I'll invest this in grog and tax-sheltered annuities.
TRGT311	Gee, it's pretty.
TRGT312	The glory and brilliance of this treasure pales when compared to the radiance of Elaine's smile.
TRGT313	But it's still pretty nice.
TRGT314	Every pirate needs his treasure.
TRGT315	And this treasure is mine!
TRGT316	We must've sunk to the bottom of the bay!
TRGT317	And there's a really angry-looking skull floating around out there.

TRGT364	I think LeChuck needs it more than I do.
TRNZ365	unsanitary lucre
TRNZ366	really unclean lucre
UWNZ301	fish food
UWGT302	Too bad he couldn't reach any of this sharp stuff.
UWGT303	Euuu! No way!
UWGT304	Hi there, corpse.
UWNZ306	hacksaw
UWGT307	Looks sharp.
UWGT308	I don't want to cut myself.
UWGT309	I can't talk to a hacksaw.
UWNZ310	rusty knife
UWGT311	Rusty, but sharp.
UWGT312	I could get tetanus if I prick my finger with that.
UWGT313	It's not a very efficient-looking toothpick.
UWNZ314	fabulous idol
UWGT315	Actually, it's more like a fabulous doorstop.
UWGT316	If that was light enough to be carried by one person... 
UWGT317	 ...don't you think this guy would have just picked it up?
UWGT318	I don't think it would talk back to me.
UWNZ319	deadly meat cleaver
UWGT320	Sharp and dangerous.
UWGT321	Carrying around a meat cleaver is just going to get somebody hurt.
UWGT322	I wonder if it was ever used to kill anyone?
UWNZ323	razor sharp scissors
UWGT324	VERY sharp.
UWGT325	VERY hazardous to my delicate skin.
UWGT326	I already have the barber's scissors, why would I need these?
UWNZ327	broken glass
UWGT328	Litterbugs. Sharp, though.
UWGT329	I'm not a garbage collector
UWGT330	Whatever was in that bottle is long gone.
UWNZ331	sword
UWGT332	It's sharp. I'd better be careful.
UWGT333	It's too barnacle-encrusted to be very useful.
UWGT334	I'm no sword-swallower.
UWNZ335	ax
UWGT336	Heavy and sharp.
UWGT337	I'm afraid it would weigh me down too much.
UWGT338	Hello there, battle ax.
VDGT301	Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate.
VDVH302	Of course you are.
VDGT303	Okay, then... who are you?
VDVH304	Edward Van Helgen.
VDGT305	Not THE...
VDVH306	That's right. Mine is the name that pirates fear the most.
VDVH307	Edward `Snugglecakes` Van Helgen.
VDGT308	Dude!
VDNN309	Edward Van Helgen
VDSO310	Are you still undecided about joining my crew?
VDSO311	How'd you like to join my ever-growing pirate crew?
VDSO312	I am too a gentleman!
VDSO313	Are you sure you don't want to join my crew?
VDSO314	Are you ready to set sail for adventure?
VDSO315	You went from pirating to hairstyling. Why?
VDSO316	How did you find other music-loving barber pirates?
VDSO317	Are you truly happy with this line of work?
VDSO318	I could be the fourth for your barbershop quartet!
VDSO319	Let me try out for your barbershop quartet again!
VDSO320	Let me try another song for your barbershop quartet!
VDSO321	Listen to me sing again. You'll love it this time.
VDSO322	I've got one song left for you. It's a showstopper!
VDSO323	I bet you have a ton of cool pirate stories.
VDSO324	What went so horribly wrong with that pirate voyage?
VDSO325	Whoa! Look at the time. Gotta scoot.
VDVH326	Of course. I'll meet you on board your ship when you're ready.
VDVH327	Your crew? Why would I want to be on your crew?
VDGT328	It's going to be a blast! We're going to Blood Island!
VDVH329	Sorry, Threepwood. As much as I'd love to be out on the sea again...
VDVH330	...I could never serve a captain who wasn't a gentleman and who wasn't my equal.
VDSO331	Gentleman? That's me all over!
VDSO332	I'm at least two times your equal!
VDSO333	I AM a gentleman, you big old bed-wetting doody-head!
VDSO334	Fine, be that way.
VDVH335	I told you, not unless you give me sufficient insult and beat me in a duel.
VDVH336	No, I've decided. You're clearly incapable of serving as my captain.
VDVH337	You're no match for me in a gentleman's duel.
VDVH338	And your gross incompetence at even the simplest of...
VDVH339	Ohhh! Hey! Why'd you slap me again?
VDGT340	Just felt like it.
VDVH341	Let's take this outside, shall we?
VDVH342	Then prove it. If you can defeat me in a gentleman's duel, I'll join your crew.
VDGT343	All right. Let's get to dueling!
VDVH344	No, no, no. There are rules.
VDVH345	If you want to duel with me, you have to give me sufficient insult.
VDGT346	Hmmm... okay.
VDSO347	Hey, that's a nice shirt...
VDSO348	Nice cologne you're wearing...
VDSO349	Did I mention you're a big old bed-wetting doody-head?
VDSO350	How appropriate. You fight like a cow.
VDSO351	I don't want to insult you! Why can't we just get along?
VDGT352	How long have you been colorblind?
VDVH353	Oh. Please.
VDGT354	Did you actually roll around in dung, or just dab a little behind each ear?
VDVH355	That's not the type of insult I had in mind.
VDVH356	As a matter of fact, you did. And I'm not impressed.
VDVH357	No, but I'm still not impressed.
VDVH358	THAT's an old one. Come back when you have some fresher material. Eh?
VDVH359	The music of the sea is something that takes hold of your soul and never lets go.
VDVH360	But the life of a sailor is a rough one, and the sea shows no mercy.
VDVH361	It was no easy choice to leave...
VDVH362	...but I realized that I could still enjoy the music of the sea while remaining safely on land.
VDSO363	Through affordably-priced sea shanty compilation albums?
VDSO364	By hanging out at the docks and singing to passing sailors?
VDSO365	Uh... how?
VDSO366	Great story. I'll have to hear the rest some other time.
VDVH367	Err, no...
VDVH368	No, believe me, THAT doesn't work.
VDVH369	I may return to sea one day, but for now I'm happy helping pirates look their very best.
VDVH370	At least until we find a fourth for our barbershop quartet.
VDVH371	By starting a barbershop quartet, obviously.
VDGT372	Obviously. But there are only three of you.
VDVH373	Auditions didn't go as well as we'd hoped.
VDVH374	We once had a tenor named Dominique, but he left. Artistic differences. Hmph!
VDSO375	You still haven't explained why you chose hairstyling.
VDSO376	Oh, my feet are killing me.
VDSO377	I could be the fourth for your barbershop quartet!
VDSO378	Well, that explains that. Next question.
VDVH379	What was that?
VDGT380	Huh? Oh. I'm sorry, my mind was wandering. Please go on.
VDVH381	Well, we'd spent so much time coming up with a clever name for the shop...
VDVH382	...we realized we were going to have to give up singing and actually become barbers.
VDVH383	But I still like to think that we're not just cutting hair...
VDVH384	...that maybe, just maybe, we're teaching people a little bit about themselves.
VDVH385	Uh, no, no. That's okay. Uh, I was wrong. We don't need one after all.
VDGT386	Ah, come on! I've really got a way with a ballad!
VDVH387	All right, then. Let's hear what you've got.
VDVH388	No.
VDGT389	Oh please! Please!
VDGT390	The spirit of music is in me!
VDVH391	All right, but this is the last time.
VDVH392	Am I just not getting through to you, Threepwood?
VDGT393	Come on, this time will be great. Trust me.
VDVH394	If you insist.
VDVH395	I really really REALLY don't want to.
VDGT396	No, believe me! I'm just getting warmed up.
VDVH397	Okay, whatever.
VDSO398	`There's a Monkey in My Pocket` (a popular children's song)
VDSO399	`I've Got a Friend in the Ocean` (a popular pirate shanty)
VDSO400	`Plunder On My Mind` (a popular Caribbean island anthem)
VDSO401	`Wooden Leg, Restless Heart` (a popular romantic ballad)
VDSO402	`Silver's Long Johns` (a popular commercial jingle)
VDSO403	What was I thinking? I can't sing. Never mind.
VDGT404	Oh, there's a monkey in my pocket, And he's stealing all my changeHis stare is blank and glassy,I suspect that he's deranged...
VDGT408	Once my old man spoke to good King TritonAnd asked, `Why all this senseless fightin'?``Why can't we men express emotion?`And now I've got a friend in...
VDGT412	Plunder, Plunder, how I wonderHow'd you get so doggone pretty?Home to sailors, barbers, tailorsAnd Puerto Pollo, your capitol city...
VDGT416	I'm hooked on you baby,
VDGT417	But the seas keep us apart
VDGT418	And there ain't no eyepatch big enough
VDGT419	To cover up my broken heart...
VDGT420	For those cold, dark shipboard nights,
VDGT421	We've got boxers, briefs, and tights
VDGT422	Made from cotton, silk, or satin,
VDGT423	In styles Anglo, Dutch, and Latin,
VDGT424	When you sail don't take a chance
VDGT425	Wearing nothing 'neath your pants!
VDGT426	Trust... Silver's Long Johns! (They breathe!)
VDVH427	Oh my dear sweet merciful savior in heaven!
VDGT428	Pretty good, huh?
VDVH429	You must take an oath now, before man and God...
VDVH430	...that you will never ever again sing in public.
VDGT431	So what are you telling me, exactly?
VDVH432	Great sainted jumping monkeys!
VDGT433	What do you think, huh?
VDVH434	That was even more atonal than last time!
VDVH435	Mother of all that we as humans hold sacred!
VDGT436	Well...?
VDVH437	You're actually beginning to make me physically ill. Please, stop.
VDVH438	Words! I need more words!
VDVH439	My grasp of the language is not sufficient to describe the violent, retching nausea your singing has caused me to experience.
VDGT440	I'm not following you -- is that a good thing?
VDVH441	That's odd.
VDGT442	What? What? You liked it?
VDVH443	No, no, no. It was dreadful. It's just that my queasiness has subsided...
VDVH444	...but now I'm beginning to taste metal and see spots before my eyes.
VDVH445	I'm afraid that your singing is so bad that it's caused me to have a stroke.
VDVH446	No, I couldn't...
VDGT447	Come on! I'd really like to hear some of...
VDVH448	The year was 1675. We were on a course towards the wreck of The Rattling Phlegm.
VDVH449	Our days were filled with songs of the voyage and the untold riches we'd find at our destination.
VDVH450	Two months into our journey, we realized something was horribly wrong.
VDSO451	Was it some kind of seasickness?
VDSO452	Had your ship been placed under some kind of pirate curse?
VDSO453	Were you haunted by the spiteful ghost of a former captain?
VDSO454	Is this going to be scary?
VDSO455	This story is really freaking me out. Please stop it.
VDVH456	In a manner of speaking.
VDVH457	Not as such, but we were cursed all the same.
VDVH458	No, a restless spirit would have been a welcome relief compared to the evil we faced.
VDGT459	Because I warn you, I'm easily startled and will scream like a baby.
VDVH460	Steel yourself, young pirate.
VDVH461	Well, I suppose they are just stories to you...
VDVH462	...you haven't lived through the terror.
VDGT463	Geez, sorry. I never knew you pirates were so sensitive.
VDVH464	We were all stricken with a melody...
VDVH465	...a diabolical song that I shall never forget.
VDVH466	La la la la la la la...
VDGT467	Hey, that's kind of catchy!
VDVH468	Aye, all too catchy for a crew of fifty men confined to a ship hundreds of miles from port.
VDVH469	No one could think of anything else, and many threw themselves into the sea rather than hear any more of the incessant humming.
VDVH470	We returned with but eight of our crew left.
VDVH471	The doomed voyage of The Obsessivo-Compulsivo will haunt me forever.
VLGT301	It's Merton, bull-headed god of tined silverware.
VLGT302	This village is deserted...
VLGT303	...and yet it looks as if there's going to be a great feast.
VLGT304	How curious.
VLGT305	That looks like a mask.
VLGT306	I'll just walk over here so he won't see me put this on.
VLGT307	Ick.
VLGT308	Ick.
VLGT309	I can barely see out of that mask.
VLGT310	I'd better wait to put it on.
VLGT311	If I take this off now the cannibals may eat me on general principles.
VLGT312	Hmmm... it just sits there... 
VLGT313	I get the feeling I'm missing some key ingredient.
VLGT314	Wow. The cork floats. I'm astounded.
VLGT315	Okay, it floats, but it still doesn't point anywhere.
VLGT316	Hey, neat! It points north!
VLGT317	Science is fun when you know the secret!
VLNN318	village
VLGT319	I'm not going back up there! It's too dangerous!
VLNZ320	measuring cup
VLGT321	It's decorative, yet functional.
VLGT322	It's full of sea water.
VLGT323	It's full of sugar-water.
VLGT324	It's empty.
VLGT325	I don't know where this water's been!
VLGT326	I can't use the measuring cup with that.
VLGT327	I need to use the measuring cup with something else.
VLGT328	The pin just sits at the bottom of the cup. I need to make it float.
VLGT329	The pin just sinks. I need to make it float.
VLNZ330	assorted fruits and vegetables
VLGT331	It's a table covered with different fruits and vegetables.
VLGT332	I haven't got any use for this fruit.
VLGT333	I'm not hungry right now.
VLNZ334	block of tofu
VLGT335	It's a large cube of tofu.
VLGT336	A 60-pound block of tofu won't help here.
VLGT337	I don't want to put my hand in there.
VLNZ338	auger
VLGT339	It's an auger.
VLGT340	I don't want to pierce my tongue.
VLGT341	That doesn't need to be augered.
VLGT342	It's sharp!
VLNZ343	tofu mask
VLGT344	My mask of tofu won't do anything here.
VLGT345	It's already got two eyes and a mouth.
VLNZ346	chafing dish
VLGT347	It looks like kidney pie.
VLGT348	This lukewarm chafing dish isn't hot enough to melt the cheese.
VLNZ349	chafing dish
VLGT350	It's holding cute little shrunken head brochettes.
VLNZ351	chafing dish
VLGT352	There's a tag on this one.
VLGT353	'Casserole Medley Surprise.'
VLGT354	It's probably last week's sacrifice.
VLNZ355	ornamental skulls
VLGT356	It looks like a ship's skipper, first mate, a professor and the rest.
VLNZ357	mask
VLGT358	It's a hand-carved mask in the likeness of Leroy...
VLGT359	...god of pudding.
VLNZ360	decorative centerpiece
VLGT361	Very classy.
VLNZ362	giant idol
VLGT363	It's a statue of Myron...
VLGT364	...god of parsley and other garnishes.
VLNZ365	idol
VLGT366	It's an idol of Ricky, the helpful god of finger-bowls.
VLNZ367	carved figurehead
VLGT368	It's a statue of Eunice...
VLGT369	...aardvark-headed goddess of the brown-and-serve dinner roll.
VLNZ370	figurehead
VLNZ371	figurehead
VOGT301	Hey, look here.
VOGT302	Sun-dried Spaniard crisps.
VOLH303	Ohhhhhhhhhh...
VOLH304	Mmmmmmmmmmm...
VOLH305	Crispy fried back skin...
VOLH306	...Hairless, too. Shaved?
VOGT307	Nope. 100-percent Natural.
VOLH308	Mmmmmmmmmmmm... Savory...
VOLH309	No, I must resist. Against my belief system to eat any fleshy products.
VOLH310	Please, don't tempt me.
VOGT311	I'd probably kill myself if I tried to walk down that path with this mask on!
VOLH312	Hold it!
VOLH313	Not so fast!
VOLH314	Stop!
VOLH315	What do you want?
VOGT316	Ahem.
VOLH317	Finally! You're here.
VOLH318	Come on, we're late for the sacrifice.
VONZ319	islander
VOGT320	It's the leader of the cannibals.
VOGT321	It's one of the native folk.
VGGT301	Nice place. I love what you've done with it.
VGSO302	Who are you and how did you just appear like that?
VGSO303	Don't I know you from somewhere?
VGSO304	You've helped so much and I still don't know your name.
VGSO305	Boy, have I got some stories to tell you!
VGSO306	Nice place. I love what you've done with it.
VGVY307	I am one gifted with the Second Sight, adept at manipulating the forces of nature for the benefit of all who enter my door.
VGGT308	You're a fashion consultant?
VGVY309	Well, yes, but that's not what I was referring to.
VGVY310	I am a Voodoo Priestess.
VGGT311	Neat!
VGVY312	You're an `autumn`, by the way.
VGVY313	We have known each other for a very long time, Guybrush Threepwood.
VGVY314	You've been through much, so it is understandable that you have forgotten me.
VGVY315	We met on Mêlée Island, when you were first trying to become a pirate.
VGGT316	Hang on a second. Are we going to do one of those flashback things? They always make me nauseous.
VGVY317	No, I'll make this quick.
VGVY318	I twice helped you defeat the evil pirate LeChuck, first by preparing the voodoo anti-root...
VGGT319	I'm starting to remember...
VGVY320	...and then again by helping you prepare a voodoo doll of his zombie form.
VGGT321	That's right!
VGVY322	I am known by many names on many different islands.
VGVY323	But names have little importance. You should know this more than anyone, Guybrush Threepwood.
VGGT324	Yes, you're right... Hey! Are you making fun of me?
VGVY325	I wouldn't dream of it.
VGVY326	Stories? Yes, well, I'm... sensing a great disturbance. I have to go.
VGGT327	But I've got to tell you about LeChuck! And Elaine!
VGVY328	I'm going to disappear now, in a big flash of light. Cover your eyes...
VGGT329	No, no, no, wait! It started back on Dinky Island. I knew LeChuck was close...
VGVY330	I'll be disappearing here, any moment.
VGGT331	Okay, okay. No stories.
VGVY332	Thank you. You'll have to excuse the mess. The kids came over to play with their paper voodoo dolls.
VGVY333	They're adorable children. Would you like to see some pictures?
VGSO334	NO!
VGSO335	No, please, no.
VGSO336	For the love of all that is good and holy, NO.
VGSO337	I can't think of anything I would hate more.
VGGT338	Perhaps later.
VGVY339	Yes, there's no time for that now. I sense that something terrible has happened.
VGGT340	Hey, you're good! Something terrible HAS happened!
VGGT341	I finally proposed to Elaine!
VGVY342	Congratulations! That doesn't sound so terr...
VGGT343	And when I placed the engagement ring on her hand she was placed under a horrible pirate curse and trapped for eternity as a solid gold statue!
VGVY344	Ah, that explains it. I was struck with a wave of overwhelming hatred and anger.
VGGT345	Yeah, that LeChuck was a pretty mean guy.
VGVY346	I was talking about Elaine. 
VGGT347	There's no time to worry about that now! We have to hurry!
VGVY348	Do not panic, Guybrush. She will be safe until we can break the curse...
VGVY349	You only have to worry about her being stolen. Where did you hide her?
VGSO350	Hide her?
VGSO351	Err... I can't tell you. It's too secret.
VGSO352	Err... I just remembered something. I've got to go.
VGSO353	Oh, shoot.
VGVY354	You didn't hide her?
VGVY355	She's a solid gold statue! On an island full of pirates!
VGVY356	What were you thinking?
VGVY357	Very well. But I am very much relieved to hear that she is safe and...
VGGT358	Err... I just remembered something I've got to do. See you around!
VGVY359	You didn't hide her?
VGVY360	You DID remember to hide the giant solid-gold statue of your girlfriend from all the other pirates on the island?
VGGT361	Uh... Not exactly, but you know...I
VGVY362	You left her out there on the beach, didn't you?
VGGT363	You make it sound so... incompetent.
VGVY364	Go, Guybrush! Hurry! Before you're too late!
VGGT365	Someone's stolen Elaine!
VGVY366	That is unfortunate. It will be difficult to get her back.
VGGT367	Do you know who kidnapped her?
VGVY368	Not for certain. But I suspect that it's the mangy pirates anchored in Danjer Cove.
VGSO369	Who did you say kidnapped Elaine?
VGSO370	Can you give me something to lift the curse?
VGSO371	Where am I going to find a huge, uncursed diamond ring?
VGSO372	How do I get to Blood Island?
VGSO373	Tell me again how to lift this curse.
VGSO374	I finally defeated LeChuck and his skeleton pirates!
VGSO375	About LeChuck...
VGSO376	What island is this, anyway?
VGSO377	About Plunder Island...
VGSO378	I want to know what voodoo spell you're working on.
VGSO379	I want to know more about safe hair replacement systems.
VGSO380	I want to know more about a diet I can live with.
VGSO381	I want to know more about variable-rate mortgages.
VGSO382	I want to know more about a career in TV and VCR repair.
VGSO383	I want to know more about the Aztec god, Quetzalcoatl.
VGSO384	Thanks for your help. Gotta go!
VGVY385	Yes?
VGVY386	Yes?
VGVY387	No, LeChuck's curse is a very powerful one...
VGVY388	...fueled by his anger and his intense frustration in dealing with the opposite sex.
VGVY389	I have nothing here to lift so powerful a curse, but there is one way.
VGGT390	Great! Tell me!
VGVY391	You have to replace the cursed ring with a pure one of greater or equal value.
VGVY392	A good guideline is two months' salary.
VGSO393	Where am I going to find a huge, uncursed diamond ring?
VGSO394	I had no idea this curse stuff was so complicated.
VGSO395	Isn't there a more budget-conscious way to lift this curse?
VGSO396	This sounds hopeless. Let's talk about something else.
VGVY397	That's nothing. Just be glad she wasn't turned into a magic swan.
VGGT398	What would I have to do then?
VGVY399	You don't want to know. Believe me.
VGVY400	You should be able to do it with virtually no out-of-pocket expense.
VGGT401	Perfect! How?
VGVY402	Legends speak of a whopping big diamond ring on Blood Island.
VGGT403	Blood Island? I've never heard of it.
VGVY404	You will soon become quite familiar with it.
VGVY405	But you must be careful, Guybrush.
VGVY406	I have foreseen that your journey will be filled with peril and deception.
VGVY407	I have also seen that Blood Island will be the place...
VGVY408	...where you will die.
VGSO409	Uh huh. So, any huge uncursed rings on any other islands?
VGSO410	Die? Did, did you say, `Die?` As in, me? Dead?
VGSO411	And you're saying this is a place I should go?
VGSO412	That sounds like a really bad idea. I want no part of it.
VGVY413	Don't be such a baby.
VGGT414	Isn't there a less... dangerous way?
VGGT415	What are you, nuts?
VGVY416	No. The value of the ring on Blood Island comes from its emotional significance.
VGVY417	It represents a pure, true love, a power greater than any other.
VGGT418	Oh, that's sweet. I... I think I have something in my eye.
VGVY419	Do not mock the voodoo priestess.
VGGT420	Blood Island, here I come!
VGSO421	How do I get to Blood Island?
VGSO422	Well, how will I find the ring on Blood Island?
VGSO423	Blood Island sounds dangerous! Ya have to come with me!
VGSO424	Blood Island, here I come!
VGVY425	You will need three things:
VGVY426	A map to Blood Island, for the journey is a long and dangerous one...
VGVY427	...a seaworthy ship to take you there...
VGVY428	...and an experienced crew.
VGGT429	Map, ship, and crew. Got it.
VGVY430	You need to replace the cursed ring with a pure one on Blood Island.
VGVY431	And to get to Blood Island, you need a map, a ship, and a crew.
VGGT432	Map, ship, and crew. Got it.
VGVY433	All I can say is that I see a long and painful history connected with that ring...
VGVY434	...and I feel a great sadness associated with it.
VGVY435	You will learn more once you have actually found the island.
VGVY436	No, I cannot. I have lived on three different islands in the past six years.
VGVY437	I do not wish to travel anymore.
VGVY438	Besides, this derelict is still in escrow.
VGSO439	But who will give me information and advice?
VGSO440	But who will point me in the right direction?
VGSO441	But who will explain away gaping plot holes?
VGSO442	But who will be the game's only female character?
VGGT443	You've got to come! You're my only hope!
VGVY444	No, Guybrush. There is another.
VGVY445	She's probably been stolen by the mangy pirates anchored in Danjer Cove.
VGGT446	Danjer Cove. Got it.
VGVY447	I suspect it was the work of the pirates anchored in Danjer Cove.
VGGT448	Well, they're going to regret messing with my girlfriend!
VGSO449	Who are these pirates?
VGSO450	Where is Danjer Cove?
VGSO451	This is going to be complicated, isn't it?
VGSO452	Well, they're going to regret messing with my girlfriend!
VGVY453	No one knows.
VGVY454	But people speak of strange, almost inhuman, screams coming from their ship, late into the night.
VGGT455	Creepy.
VGVY456	And their captain is a cruel, savage beast, the fiercest pirate ever to sail the Caribbean!
VGVY457	It is on the west side of the island.
VGVY458	The way is extremely treacherous; few men have seen Danjer Cove and lived.
VGGT459	Figures.
VGVY460	You have no idea.
VGGT461	What's that?
VGVY462	Oh, I said, `Good luck!`
VGGT463	Danjer Cove, huh?
VGGT464	You might want to stay indoors. This could get messy.
VGVY465	True evil can never be destroyed completely.
VGGT466	But I heard him blow up and everything!
VGVY467	You'd be surprised at how much abuse an evil undead zombie pirate can take.
VGSO468	How can I finally destroy him for good?
VGSO469	I finally found Big Whoop and was enormously disappointed!
VGSO470	What makes you think LeChuck will be back?
VGSO471	I'm sick of talking about that jerk LeChuck.
VGVY472	No one knows. His power seems to grow with every incarnation.
VGVY473	You may have dealt with him for now, but this respite can only be temporary at best.
VGVY474	Big Whoop is pure evil. You were lucky to escape alive.
VGGT475	I can't remember much about it... just that I was expecting so much more, and felt so let down.
VGVY476	Yes, it is the source of much of LeChuck's power.
VGGT477	Well, I'm never going back there again.
VGVY478	I have foreseen otherwise.
VGVY479	You will return to Big Whoop and confront LeChuck once again.
VGVY480	Some men can search their entire lives and never discover their reason for being.
VGVY481	LeChuck has found his: to perpetually rise from the dead and torment you and Elaine.
VGVY482	It's what he does best.
VGGT483	Gee, when you put it that way, it's kind of hard to stay mad at him.
VGVY484	You have landed on Plunder Island.
VGGT485	Plunder Island. Sounds appropriately piratey.
VGVY486	Naturally. It's a sort of retirement community for ex-pirates and their spouses.
VGGT487	Hmmm. Sounds... exciting.
VGVY488	Lately there has been all too much excitement on the island.
VGVY489	All centering around Governor Marley, LeChuck, and a giant chicken.
VGGT490	Thanks, I've heard all I needed to know.
VGSO491	Elaine is governor of this island, too?
VGSO492	How did you end up on Plunder Island?
VGSO493	What about this giant chicken business?
VGSO494	Thanks, I've heard all I needed to know.
VGVY495	Actually, Elaine is the governor of the entire tri-island area, comprised of Mêlée, Booty, and Plunder Islands.
VGVY496	She moved to her fort here on Plunder after the kitchen and landscaping staff quit her Booty Island mansion.
VGVY497	I realized that my location in the swamp on Scabb Island wasn't ideally situated.
VGGT498	So you moved to a swamp on a different island?
VGVY499	I just said I could see the future; I never claimed to be an expert in real estate.
VGVY500	Ah yes, Guybrush. You have landed on an island gripped...
VGVY501	...by the cold, clammy hand...
VGVY502	...of FEAR!
VGGT503	Don't you think you're being a bit over-dramatic?
VGVY504	No. Lights!
VGVY505	This was a peaceful island, until the Great Beast landed on our shores.
VGVY506	Some say It was sent to make the islanders pay for their cruelty; others claim it was simply blind fate.
VGVY507	Whatever the impetus, It came.
VGSO508	What came?
VGSO509	A giant chicken?
VGSO510	The infamous bear-pig of Plunder Island?
VGSO511	Is this going to be scary?
VGSO512	AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
VGVY513	No, even more hideous!
VGGT514	Because I warn you, I've got a notoriously weak bladder.
VGVY515	Steady yourself, Guybrush...
VGVY516	What? What? I'm not even at the scary part yet!
VGGT517	Oh. Sorry. Go ahead.
VGVY518	It was El Pollo Diablo, the Giant Demon Chicken!
VGVY519	Tall as a man and twice as powerful, his massive drumsticks propel him through the dark jungle with ease.
VGVY520	No one has seen the Beast, but on the eve of the full moon...
VGVY521	...his blood-curdling squawk can be heard from every corner of this wretched island.
VGVY522	In the dark of night, he roosts patiently... watching... waiting... for the one day...
VGGT523	No, no, no wait. Don't tell me. Let me guess...
VGSO524	He's hatching a diabolical scheme.
VGSO525	He's establishing a new pecking order.
VGSO526	He's going to buck-buck-buck the system.
VGSO527	He's crossing the road... to freedom!
VGVY528	He roams the island, exacting terrible vengeance on those who would capture and eat his smaller brethren.
VGGT529	Oh, give me a break.
VGVY530	There were once others like you, skeptical to the true nature of the Beast...
VGVY531	...but they're all dead now, pecked into a bloody pulp by his savage beak.
VGVY532	But I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
VGGT533	Yeah, right. Whatever.
VGVY534	Voodoo spell?
VGVY535	Oh, this. This is just a fondue I'm making for tonight. Would you like to try it?
VGGT536	Does it have any skink toes in it?
VGVY537	A few.
VGGT538	I'll pass.
VGVY539	I can imagine. Didn't you have a beard the last time I saw you?
VGGT540	I sure did! A really cool one!
VGGT541	I wonder what happened to it...
VGVY542	I'll share with you knowledge passed from mother to daughter in my family for generations.
VGGT543	What's that?
VGVY544	Low fat, high fiber. It works.
VGVY545	Bad idea. Though attractive to the first-time homeowner, the rate reacts wildly to fluctuations in the market and can work against the buyer over time.
VGVY546	You're best off starting with a 20 percent down payment and a variable-rate mortgage, then refinancing at a fixed rate after one or two years, as the market warrants.
VGGT547	Could you repeat that?
VGVY548	No.
VGVY549	So you want to make more money.
VGGT550	Sure, we all do!
VGVY551	Stick to pirating.
VGVY552	Really sweet guy. Not at all as bloodthirsty as they make him out to be.
VGVY553	Shorter than you might think.
VXMR301	El Pollo Diablo!
VXMR302	At last, one of my demonic brethren, come to set me free!
VXGT303	Oh, brother...
VXMR304	Come, release me so that I might run free alongside you as we terrorize the mortals of this island!
VXGT305	I'm out of here.
VXMR306	Wait!
VXMR307	Don't leave!
VXMR308	El Pollo Diablo!
VXMR309	You have returned for me!
VXGT310	Oops!
VXMR311	At last we can begin our reign of demonic terror...
VXMR312	Wait!
VXMR313	BOO!
VXGT314	AHHHHH!
VXMR315	Bwahahahahahaha!
VXGT316	Oh, it's just you again.
VXMR317	Just your most terrifying image of evil revisited!
VXGT318	Yeah, right.
VXMR319	I bring you warning from the infernal realms... do not go farther into the swamp!
VXMR320	Turn back! Turn back! Darkness will envelop you!
VXMR321	Bwahahahahahaha!
VXNZ322	Murray
VXGT323	It's my pal from LeChuck's ship.
VXGT324	I don't know if I want to carry him around. He's kind of annoying.
VXGT325	I think he wants to be alone right now.
VXMR326	I have no gut to bust.
VXMR327	Mmmmmmmm...
VXNZ328	bovine skull
VXSQ329	Mooooo...
VXSQ330	I am Moosferatu, the demonic Jersey Cow.
VXMR331	Oh Moosferatu, I am Murray!
VXMR332	Free me, and I shall forever be your faithful nether-worldly servant!
VXGT333	(Laugh) Gotcha!
VXMR334	You...
VXSQ335	Mooooo...
VXMR336	You...
VXNZ337	wrecked ship
VXGT338	It looks like it was thrown here by a typhoon.
VIGT301	I'm sure it won't do anything.
VIGT302	After all, it's just a paper voodoo-doll.
VIGA303	Ahhhhhhh.
VIGA304	What a relief!
VIGA305	Oh! The pain!
VIGA306	Ooooh! Migraine!
VIGA307	Make it stop! Aaaaaah!
VIGA308	Yeeeeee!
VIGA309	Ahh... no, it's at the small of my back... no, higher... little higher... RIGHT there! Oh, perfect!
VIGT310	ELAINE!
VIGT311	I've got to get her back!
VIGT312	This is so embarrassing.
VIGT313	It looks like I'm going to need some more help.
VIGT314	Hmmm...
VIGT315	She must be out.
VIGT316	Wow! I got a whole pack of gum!
VINZ317	pin
VIGT318	It's a voodoo pin.
VIGT319	No, I have a very low threshold of pain.
VIGT320	I don't want to pin that.
VIGT321	I don't want to poke myself with a pin.
VIGT322	Cool! A magnetic pin!
VIGT323	The mind boggles at the possibilities!
VIGT324	I've already magnetized the pin.
VINZ325	voodoo doll
VIGT326	How cute!
VIGT327	A paper voodoo-doll.
VIGT328	It's a paper voodoo-doll.
VIGT329	I don't need it.
VIGT330	It's just a toy.
VINZ331	paste
VIGT332	It's a bottle of paste.
VIGT333	I'm not that hungry.
VIGT334	I can't paste that.
VIGT335	I need something to put the paste on.
VIGT336	The plug is all pasty now.
VIGT337	There's already enough paste on it.
VINZ338	alligator
VIGT339	It's a big stuffed alligator, with an unusually long tongue.
VIGT340	He's stuffed.
VIGT341	I wouldn't know where to put him.
VINZ342	alligator tongue
VIGT343	It's the alligator's tongue... and it's still moist!
VIGT344	Now that's just wrong.
VINZ345	piranha
VIGT346	I think he's had his teeth capped.
VIGT347	Not without tartar sauce.
VINZ348	unusual tureen
VIGT349	It's full of some mysterious, unrecognizable substance.
VIGT350	No. It smells a bit like skink toes.
VINZ351	bookcase
VIGT352	There's a copy of 'I'm O.K., You're a Zombie.'
VIGT353	No time for reading.
VINZ354	gumball machine
VIGT355	`Admiral Sweetums Bit-o-Jerky Bubblegum. Five cents.`
VIGT356	I have to get the gum out of the machine first.
VIGT357	I'm no vandal. I'm a pirate.
VIGT358	It ate my nickel.
VINZ359	pack of gum
VIGT360	Bit-o-Jerky bubblegum.
VIGT361	Mmm...tastes like sirloin!
VIGT362	I don't need a new stick.
VIGT363	My old one still has some flavor left.
VIGT364	That doesn't need gum.
VIGT365	This gum feels warm.
VINZ366	toy scissors
VIGT367	I don't want those dull, little scissors.
WGSO001	I'm Guybrush Threepwood, who are you?
WGSO002	You don't scare me, you mangy pirate!
WGSO003	Hello. Please don't kill me.
WGSO004	Aaargh!
WGSO005	I'm selling these fine leather jackets.
WGSO006	Aren't you a little short for a pirate?
WGWY007	I'm the evil pirate, Bloodnose!
WGWY008	The wickedest fiend ever to sail under the banner of King Death!
WGWY009	I'd as soon chew your nose off as look at you!
WGWY010	I'm feared from Bristol to Barbados!
WGWY011	Brave talk, boy!
WGWY012	But now you're face to face with the wicked pirate Bloodnose!
WGWY013	I'm the scourge of four out of the seven seas.
WGWY014	Oh, don't worry about it.
WGWY015	I don't...
WGWY016	...Um...
WGWY017	I mean...
WGWY018	Ye had best beg for your life, ya fetid flounder!
WGWY019	Woe be to ye who fall victim to the zombie pirate LeChuck!
WGWY020	Aye!
WGWY021	Really?
WGGT022	Of course!
WGGT023	Well...
WGGT024	No.
WGGT025	I'm lying.
WGWY026	In that case I don't want one.
WGGT027	Sorry we couldn't make a deal.
WGGT028	So, I'll be going now.
WGWY029	Oh, no ya don't.
WGWY030	Cross me again and I'll chum for sharks with ya!
WGWY031	Hold yer tongue, captive!
WGWY032	Or I'll be holdin' it fer ya!
WGGT033	Eeewww!
WGSO034	You sound pretty tough.
WGSO035	How tough are you again?
WGSO036	Well, I'm pretty tough myself!
WGSO037	I am so tough!
WGSO038	Yes, I am!
WGSO039	Are so!
WGSO040	Are you wearing a fake beard?
WGSO041	Ya scurvy sea dog!
WGSO042	Is that a real eyepatch?
WGSO043	Is that hook for real?
WGSO044	Can I borrow your cannon for a second?
WGWY045	I'm so tough, in junior high, I stuffed Davy Jones in his locker.
WGWY046	I'm so tough, I could survive being flogged with a cat o' nine-tails for half an hour...
WGWY047	...or three cats o' five-tails for eighteen minutes.
WGWY048	I'm so tough, I...
WGWY049	...er...um...
WGWY050	I drink milk straight from the carton!
WGGT051	Ooooh!
WGWY052	Of course it's not fake!
WGWY053	Bloodnose the Pirate would not have a fake beard!
WGGT054	Yes, it is!
WGGT055	It's been glued to your ear hair!
WGWY056	Actually, it's a highly sophisticated beard weave...
WGWY057	...made from the chest and back hair of real pirates!
WGWY058	I'm hoping it'll take root if I don't wash it for a while!
WGWY059	Aye!
WGWY060	Sure it be real!
WGGT061	Then why are you wearing a monocle underneath it?
WGWY062	It keeps the dust out o' me eye socket!
WGWY063	Of course it's real!
WGWY064	In Madagascar, it was.
WGWY065	A vicious shark tore off me hand.
WGWY066	What a struggle it was. I remember...
WGGT067	It is so a fake!
WGWY068	It is not!
WGWY069	Well...
WGWY070	O.K., it is.
WGWY071	See, I haven't lost my hand yet.
WGWY072	This is sort of a training-hook.
WGWY073	I'm wearing this just to get used to the feel of it.
WGWY074	Captain LeChuck says he'll cut my hand off when he gets some free time.
WGWY075	I do have a hang nail.
WGWY076	It'll probably get infected.
WGWY077	No, ya scheming scalawag!
WGWY078	Ya scrappy scofflaw!
WGWY079	Ya steamin' soufflé!
WGWY080	Ye won't be touchin' this weapon o' destruction!
WGWY081	You!
WGWY082	Don't make me laugh!
WGWY083	You couldn't even grow a decent beard!
WGGT084	Well, what about YOUR beard?
WGGT085	And furthermore...
WGGT086	Hey...
WGGT087	How did you know about my attempted beard?
WGWY088	Er...
WGWY089	Pirate's intuition.
WGWY090	You are not!
WGWY091	No, you're not!
WGWY092	Are not!
WGWY093	Oh, yeah?
WGWY094	Well, I want a cracker!
WGGT095	What kind of a comeback is that?
WGWY096	That's not terrifying?
WGGT097	Not in the least.
WGWY098	How strange.
WGWY099	I'm sure I said it right.
WGNN100	Wally
WGGT101	Hey! Wait a minute!
WGGT102	You're not a pirate!
WGGT103	Wally!
WGGT104	Don't you recognize me?
WGGT105	It's Guybrush Threepwood!
WGWY106	Oh, gee...
WGWY107	Hello, Mr. Wood.
WGWY108	How did you know it was me?
WGGT109	You have 'Wally' embroidered on your hat.
WGWY110	Darn.
WGGT111	The last time I saw you, we were prisoners in LeChuck's dungeon.
WGGT112	Why would you sign on with a ship of the living dead?
WGWY113	Well, Mr. Brush...
WGWY114	...at first I had some misgivings about it.
WGWY115	But thanks to LeChuck's seminars, motivational lectures...
WGWY116	...and audio books-on-parrot, I've become a vicious corsair!
WGWY117	They gave me the skills I needed for a rewarding...
WGWY118	...lucrative career as a pirate.
WGWY119	You can too!
WGWY120	Ask me how!
WGSO121	Tell me about these seminars.
WGSO122	Tell me about these motivational lectures.
WGSO123	Tell me about these audio books.
WGSO124	Do you have any literature I could look at?
WGSO125	Tell me more!
WGSO126	I'm not in the mood for sales hype.
WGWY127	The seminars really brought things into focus.
WGWY128	You don't know how empowering it is...
WGWY129	...to be able to say to yourself...
WGWY130	'Yes. I am a despicable, filthy, villainous pirate...'
WGWY131	'...deserving blame and censure...'
WGWY132	'...but THAT pirate...'
WGWY133	'...is who I want to be.'
WGWY134	Everyone was really very supportive.
WGWY135	We had this great feeling of synergy.
WGWY136	Then LeChuck kicked down the door and said...
WGWY137	'Ye lazy scum!'
WGWY138	'Get back ta work or I'll beat you with yer own legs.'
WGWY139	Well, they weren't lectures as such.
WGWY140	It was what LeChuck described as flogging the inner child.
WGWY141	To become a pirate, the audio books-on-parrot are the key.
WGWY142	You get a set of twelve parrots...
WGWY143	...one a month.
WGWY144	Return as many as you like.
WGWY145	Keep them all and live.
WGWY146	They teach you to talk just like a pirate!
WGWY147	All the key phrases are in there!
WGWY148	'Blow the man down.'
WGWY149	'Shiver me timbers.'
WGWY150	'Who's a pretty bird?'
WGWY151	All the phrases a pirate needs to command respect on the high-seas!
WGWY152	Here.
WGWY153	At least take this literature.
WGWY154	You may change your mind.
WGWY155	Here.
WGWY156	This leaflet explains the basic philosophy I follow.
WGSO157	Set me free, Wally.
WGSO158	What's behind that door?
WGSO159	What's behind the door again?
WGSO160	What are LeChuck's plans?
WGSO161	What are LeChuck's plans again?
WGSO162	Snap out of it Wally!
WGSO163	You're a failure as a pirate.
WGWY164	I can't, Mr. Brush.
WGWY165	I'm the evil pirate Bloodnose, now.
WGWY166	And besides...
WGWY167	...even if you got up on deck, LeChuck would cut you to ribbons.
WGWY168	Oooooh...
WGWY169	That's the door to LeChuck's treasure hold.
WGWY170	There's heaps and piles of gold and silver.
WGWY171	He's brought all the loot he's ever stolen to give to Elaine.
WGWY172	LeChuck is convinced that he can buy Elaine's love.
WGGT173	Hmmmm...
WGWY174	It's LeChuck's fabulous treasure hold.
WGWY175	He's been working on a secret weapon.
WGWY176	Some incredibly powerful cannonball.
WGWY177	He's going to use it to blow down the walls of the fort...
WGWY178	...so his crew can overrun the island!
WGWY179	He's going to blow up the fort with a magic cannon ball.
WGWY180	That's Bloodnose to you, ya scurvy sea-bass!
WGWY181	The only thing that'll be snappin' around here is yer neck!
WGWY182	Shut yer trap, ya yellow-bellied blowfish!
WGWY183	One more peep out of you and I'll do ya in!
WGSO184	Peep.
WGSO185	Word.
WGSO186	Try it, shrimpy.
WGSO187	You haven't got the guts!
WGSO188	You wouldn't dare!
WGSO189	You and what navy?
WGSO190	You're a cartographer, not a pirate.
WGSO191	Just go ahead and shoot.
WGWY192	I am not!
WGWY193	I'm a vicious pirate.
WGGT194	You've got 'I luv maps' embroidered on your shirt.
WGWY195	That's a coincidence!
WGWY196	Now keep quiet before I fill you full of lead.
WGWY197	Ya scabrous swab!
WGWY198	One more word and I'll let you have it!
WGWY199	Ya jigglin' jellyfish!
WGWY200	Ya sanguine sasquatch!
WGWY201	Don't make me use this pistol on you!
WGWY202	OK!
WGWY203	That's it!
WGWY204	I'm gonna fill you with so full of bullets...
WGWY205	...you'll get a job as a bean-bag chair!
WGWY206	I'm gonna blast ya!
WGWY207	I'm gonna...
WGWY208	...I'm...
WGWY209	...gonna...
WGWY210	...<sniff>...
WGWY211	Oh, I can't do it!
WGWY212	I just can't!
WGWY213	<sob>
WGWY214	You're right, Mr. Wood!
WGWY215	I'm just not a pirate!
WGWY216	I'm not ferocious, or bloodthirsty, or hateful, or anything!
WGWY217	I'm not even...
WGWY218	<whimper>
WGWY219	I'm not even unpleasant!
WGWY220	Waaaaaaaaah!
WGGT221	Oh. There, there.
WGWY222	<weep>
WGWY223	Thanks...<sniff>...Mr. Brush.
WGWY224	I'll just be over here...
WLGT001	I can't quite squeeze past this cannon.
WLWY002	Move out of the way!
WLWY003	I can't fire the cannon with you standing there!
WLGT004	If I gave you your arm back, what would you do with it?
WLMR005	I'd terrorize the South Seas!
WLMR006	I'd torture the living!
WLMR007	I'd demolish the...er...
WLMR008	What I meant to say was I'd use it to pet kittens.
WLGT009	(Laugh) Nope.
WLGT010	You blew it.
WLMR011	Drat.
WLMR012	Well, they've messed with the wrong skull this time! Ha Ha!
WLMR013	If I could just get my hands on that gunner! If I could just get my hands, period!
WLMR014	Ah, well. I guess I'll just have to look on the bright side of this.
WLMR015	At least I've lost some weight.
WLMR016	Boy! There's not much to do out here when you're just a bodiless head.
WLMR017	I could pass the time by whistling if I had lips.
WLMR018	This is just SO unfair!
WLMR019	Now everybody's going to storm the fort and I'm going to be stuck here.
WLMR020	Hey!
WLMR021	Hey! That's my arm!
WLMR022	Give that back!
WLNZ023	debris
WLGT024	There's a skeletal arm, floating in the water.
WLGT025	I can't reach that far!
WLGT026	The hook won't reach.
WLGT027	That will reach it, but it can't catch hold.
WLNZ028	cutlass
WLGT029	It's a sharp cutlass.
WLGT030	That's a little large to pick my teeth with.
WLGT031	That doesn't need cutting.
WLGT032	I don't want to use this cutlass for no reason.
WLNZ033	skeleton arm
WLGT034	It's a skeleton arm.
WLGT035	It's a skeleton arm with paste all over it.
WLGT036	I can't use the skeleton arm with that.
WLGT037	I can't use the skeleton arm with that.
WLGT038	It's all bony and creepy and stuff.
WLNZ039	floating skull
WLGT040	It's a horrible skull.
WLGT041	I think it would bite me.
WLGT042	I've got nothing to say to him.
WLGT043	No.
WLGT044	He'd just use it for evil.
WLNZ045	porthole
WLGT046	There's a strange glow coming from that porthole.
WLGT047	Can anybody down there hear me?
WLGT048	I guess not.
WLNZ049	porthole
WLGT050	It's a brightly lit porthole.
WLGT051	Is there anyone down in the hold?
WLGT052	I don't think anyone is there.
WLNZ053	gunport
WLGT054	It's another gun bay.
WLGT055	Hey!
WLGT056	Is anyone over there?
WLGT057	There's no one over there.
WLGT058	I can't squeeze past this cannon to get over there.
WLNZ059	muzzle
WLGT060	It's the muzzle of the cannon.
WLGT061	The cannon is already loaded.
WLNN301	talking skull
WDGT301	Peeeewwww!!
WDWR302	Yeah, kid? What is it?
WDSO303	Yikes! What is that horrible smell?
WDSO304	Am I the only one nauseated by that terrible stench?
WDSO305	What are you guys doing here?
WDSO306	How does this whole booth work again?
WDSO307	I want to shoot the cannon! I want to shoot the cannon!
WDSO308	Fire the cannon again!
WDSO309	What in the world is meringue?
WDSO310	What's Dinghy Dog really like in person?
WDSO311	Could you, uh, introduce me to Dinghy Dog?
WDSO312	Dinghy Dog is really cool, huh?
WDSO313	I bet Dinghy Dog gets paid a lot of money, right?
WDSO314	I bet Dinghy Dog could beat you up.
WDSO315	Never mind.
WDWR316	I dunno, kid. Whipped egg whites, I guess.
WDWR317	It's a giant rat suit, you little brat.
WDWR318	What did you expect? Roses?
WDWR319	Okay, okay. The suit smells. We've heard it.
WDWR320	Everybody just come over and pick on the giant rat man.
WDWR321	It's `Blow the Man Down`, the most fun on the midway.
WDWR322	Hit the funny clown and win a fantastic prize!
WDWR323	Watch the pies fly from the cannon with blinding speed and loud report... 
WDWR324	...and if your aim is true, go home with your winnings.
WDWR325	Join in the laughs with your happy sailor host Wharf Rat and his pal Monty Meringue.
WDGT326	What flavor?
WDWR327	What?
WDGT328	What flavor are the pies today?
WDWR329	I don't know! Lemon meringue, I think.
WDWR330	What kind of a stupid question is that?
WDWR331	It's not that complex a concept, kid.
WDWR332	Fire pies from the cannon at the guy in the clown suit.
WDWR333	Ya hit him and win a prize.
WDWR334	It's Great fun.
WDWR335	Sorry, little guy, you've already seen it enough times.
WDWR336	Hey! These pies aren't cheap, you know.
WDWR337	Sorry, little boy, you're too young.
WDWR338	`Blow the Man Down` is for older kids.
WDGT339	That's discrimination!
WDGT340	How do I know it really works if I can't see it go off?
WDWR341	Okay, kid. You want to see the cannon fire? Here we go.
WDWR342	I already showed it to you.
WDGT343	Do it again! Do it again!
WDWR344	All right, kid. Just one more time.
WDWR345	What are you asking me for?
WDWR346	I'm just a giant rat.
WDWR347	I'm not allowed to associate with His Highness The Great and Mighty Dinghy Dog.
WDWR348	No, I can't.
WDWR349	Now go away.
WDWR350	Oh, yeah. He's a regular saint.
WDWR351	So much more gifted a performer than any common old giant rat.
WDWR352	Give a guy a big dog suit and he turns into a...a freaking prima donna.
WDWR353	Yeah, and so what if he does?
WDWR354	It doesn't take any talent to make a big puppy dog appealing.
WDWR355	Now, getting children to hang around a giant rat...(Laugh)
WDWR356	...that's art.
WDGT357	I bet his suit doesn't stink, either.
WDWR358	You know, you're really starting to bug me, kid.
WDWR359	Could not.
WDGT360	I bet he could.
WDWR361	I'll tell you what, kid: why don't you go take a swipe at him... 
WDWR362	...and then come back here and tell me what happened, huh?
WXNZ301	pepper
WXGT302	It's a chili pepper.
WXGT303	Pepper, you're going undercover!
WXGT304	I can't use a pepper with that.
WXGT305	I've never been a good cook.
WXNZ306	pepper plant
WXGT307	It's a wild pepper plant.
WXGT308	I only need one.
WXNZ309	door
WXGT310	The lock's too big for this card.
WXNZ311	window
WXGT312	It's an open window at the top of the windmill.
WXGT313	I can't reach it.
WXNZ314	windmill blades
WXGT315	They're spinning around the top of the windmill.
WXGT316	I can't hold on with my bare hands.
WXNZ317	barrel
WXGT318	There's a barrel at the top of the windmill.
WXGT319	It's full of fermenting sugar water used for making rum.
WXGT320	It's full of sugar-water now.
WXNN321	jar of water
WXGT322	It's already got plenty of sugar water in it.
WKGT301	Haggis...
WKHM302	Aye?
WKSO303	Mutiny is a big step...
WKSO304	Are you sure you don't want to be pirates again?
WKSO305	Join me or I'll KILL you all!
WKSO306	How are the repairs coming?
WKSO307	You mutineers had best beware!
WKSO308	My that's a big bottle of lotion you have there.
WKSO309	Could I have just a little bit of lotion?
WKSO310	There's no way that I can have even a drop of lotion?
WKSO311	What did you want in exchange for the lotion?
WKSO312	I'll let you get back to work.
WKHM313	We need to seal the hull o' the ship, but we're out o' tar.
WKHM314	If ye can find a substitute fer tar, I'll let ya have the lotion.
WKHM315	Beware of what?
WKGT316	Well, for one thing...
WKHM317	Aye.
WKSO318	I'll put a terrible pirate curse on you!
WKSO319	You'll be driven to madness by the shame of your own guilt!
WKSO320	The sea hates a deserter, and she'll swallow you up.
WKSO321	If I wore a kilt, I wouldn't wear highly polished shoes.
WKGT322	If I wore a kilt, I wouldn't wear highly polished shoes.
WKGT323	I'll put a terrible pirate curse on you!
WKGT324	You'll be driven to madness by the shame of your own guilt!
WKGT325	The sea hates a deserter, and she'll swallow you up.
WKHM326	Could ya be turnin' Bill into solid gold, like yer girlfriend?
WKGT327	I guess that's not much of a threat.
WKHM328	No, lad.
WKHM329	Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be just fine, lad. Just fine.
WKHM330	I do this ALL the time.
WKHM331	No, lad. The sea hates phone solicitors that call at mealtimes.
WKHM332	It will be the Alps what hates a deserter.
WKGT333	Oh, shucks. I always get those two confused.
WKHM334	Ach! By me Great Aunt Fergus!
WKHM335	Ye be right, laddie! I HAD best beware!
WKHM336	Well...maybe we could make a deal.
WKHM337	Ya see, we need to be repairin' the ship.
WKHM338	She's leaky as a colander.
WKHM339	And for some unknown reason, the ship's supplies o' tar have been depleted.
WKHM340	How the previous crew could set sail without any tar aboard eludes me.
WKHM341	But the fact is unless we get us some tar or somethin' like it, we're doomed to this island for good.
WKHM342	Aye, I'd give ya the whole bloomin' bottle of lotion...
WKHM343	...if 'ya could find me somethin' to patch the ship so we can be on our way home.
WKHM344	That's right she be...
WKHM345	...and don't 'ye be gettin' any ideas 'bout stealin' it!
WKHM346	We're sure to be needin' it. Ya see...
WKHM347	...carpentry in this tropical climate can and will prematurely age yer skin!
WKHM348	'Tis but one of the many hardships a pirate must face daily during this barbarous age.
WKHM349	Aye! And if we pirates didn't carry hand lotion aboard all our ships, we'd probably die from the chafing.
WKGT350	Wow! If I were doing a history report on pirates and I included that fact I'd get an A+.
WKGT351	We're talkin' GUARANTEED A+.
WKGT352	And that A+ just might get you into the college of your choice.
WKGT353	Think about it.
WKHM354	Look, I told ye to forget it!
WKGT355	...are you sure you won't reconsider?
WKHM356	Aye, lad. We're all agreed.
WKHM357	We'd rather feel the spray of detangler in our faces than the spray of the ocean.
WKHM358	Aye, we're sure.
WKHM359	We'd all rather be cutting hair than cutting throats.
WKHM360	Well...except for Bill.
WKGT361	Of course.
WKHM362	Of course you will, laddie.
WKHM363	By the way, have you got any duct tape, laddie? We're reattaching the mainsail.
WKGT364	Um...no.
WKHM365	That's a shame. I guess we'll have to use nails then.
WKHM366	Sorry, lad.
WKGT367	Oh, shoot.
WKHM368	Well lad, things could be worse.
WKHM369	There's plenty o' lumber on this island, so we'll be able to repair all the major holes in the hull.
WKHM370	We'll also be addin' a hardwood dance floor on the lido deck.
WKGT371	Nice.
WKHM372	Aye. It's somethin' we've been talkin' about for a while.
XGXM301	I feel a dark presence coming over me...
XGGT302	Hi there!
XGXM303	Aieee!
XGGS304	Ahhh!
XGGS305	Please! Keep it down! No screaming!
XGGS306	Oh, my head...
XGSO307	Hi, I'm Guybrush. And you would be...?
XGSO308	Tell me my fortune! Tell me my fortune!
XGSO309	What's in the cards for me? Fame? Fortune? Romance?
XGSO310	There must be some mistake. Read my tarot cards again.
XGSO311	I'm feeling luckier. Give me another tarot reading.
XGSO312	Hit me.
XGSO313	How about giving me one more tarot reading?
XGSO314	Would you happen to know any good hangover remedies?
XGSO315	Do you know anything about the lost ring of Blood Island?
XGSO316	Where can I find this Goodsoup diamond?
XGSO317	Never mind.
XGNN318	Madame Xima
XGXM319	I am Madame Xima...
XGGT320	Whatever. Tell me my fortune!
XGXM321	I do not think you wish to hear.
XGXM322	There are things of which a man is better off being ignorant.
XGGT323	But I'm already ignorant of so many things! I want to know my future!
XGXM324	No. You are not meant to know...
XGGT325	I bet you just can't do it. That's the problem.
XGGT326	You can't do it, and you're afraid everyone will find out you're just a phony.
XGXM327	You know, I could put a curse on you that would make every morsel of food you eat...
XGXM328	...become a ravenous cockroach inside your intestines...
XGXM329	...giving you the most excruciating death imaginable.
XGGT330	So are you going to tell me my fortune or not?
XGXM331	I'm not kidding.
XGGT332	Okay, okay.
XGXM333	(sigh) Very well. We will consult the cards.
XGXM334	The process of reading the tarot is a very complex one...
XGXM335	...each draw of the cards foretells an upcoming event in your life.
XGXM336	When assembled, they will tell the story of your future...
XGXM337	...a future filled with twists and...
XGXM338	AIEEEEEE!
XGGS339	Good lord, woman! Stop that screaming!
XGGT340	What is it? Is that a good AIEEEEEE?
XGXM341	It is DEATH!
XGGT342	In the tarot, `Death` just means `Change`, right?
XGGT343	I mean, it's nothing to get worried about, right?
XGXM344	Um... yes, sure. Whatever you say.
XGXM345	Now please, go.
XGXM346	There is no mistaking your fate, Guybrush.
XGXM347	The cards do not lie.
XGXM348	But if you insist...
XGXM349	Once again, it is DEATH.
XGXM350	Luck is not involved here, Guybrush.
XGXM351	It is your destiny!
XGGT352	Density, shmensity.
XGXM353	Not `density`. `Destiny`.
XGGT354	Whatever. Let's see what the cards say this time.
XGXM355	The card says `DEATH`.
XGGT356	Are you sure you're not dealing from the bottom of the deck?
XGXM357	Remember that curse I told you about?
XGGT358	Okay, okay.
XGXM359	DEATH.
XGGT360	How many of those cards do you have, anyway?
XGXM361	This is evil work, Guybrush.
XGXM362	The fates have conspired against you...
XGXM363	...and no man can interfere!
XGXM364	Your path has been determined.
XGGT365	Okay, I get your point, I really do.
XGGT366	Just one more time.
XGGT367	For Guybrush.
XGXM368	(gasp!)
XGGT369	Let me guess... DEATH?
XGXM370	Leave this place!
XGGT371	Huh?
XGXM372	You are putting us all in grave danger!
XGXM373	Your very presence will bring us nothing but sickness, tragedy, and death!
XGGT374	Oh yeah? Well...
XGXM375	Demon! Demon!
XGNN376	tarot cards
XGNN377	tarot card
XGXM378	My people are adept at the art of clearing the foggy head.
XGXM379	The process is simple:
XGXM380	First, you must find four dozen leeches.
XGGT381	Leeches?
XGXM382	Then, hang the victim upside down from the top of a birch tree.
XGGT383	Upside down?
XGXM384	Build a fire underneath the victim, using twenty gallons of alcohol and bat excrement as fuel.
XGGT385	Excrement?
XGXM386	Remove all your clothes and dance about the bonfire, chanting in the language of the ancients...
XGGT387	Okay, hold it. This is getting a little bit weird.
XGXM388	What can I say? It works.
XGGT389	Thanks, but I think I'll try something else.
XGXM390	I sense tremendous sorrow in connection with that ring.
XGXM391	And a great part missing. A beautiful diamond.
XGGT392	Where is the diamond?
XGXM393	I see a dark cave, filled with evil men.
XGXM394	And a place of death...
XGXM395	...a dark island in the form of a giant skull!
XGGT396	Madame Xima, I...
XGXM397	Be gone!
XGXM398	You will bring death to all who surround you!
XGXM399	No good can come of this!
BBFP005	Nice boots, huh?
BBTP010	...Sorry.
BBFP015	Hey! What d'ya know?
BBFP020	I really AM big-boned!
BBTP025	Uh-oh, quiet!
BBTP030	Here comes Captain LeChuck.
BBLC035	Avast thar, ye lubbers!
BBLC040	Set sail for my stronghold on Monkey Island. I'll unleash my entire army of the undead. This time, Elaine will be mine!
BBLC045	Ah, Elaine! 'Twill be a sweet day in hell when ya feel the fiery breath of my kiss on yer lips, and become my undead bride. And I'll destroy any man who dares get in my way!!
BBLC050	Sufferin' Sailors, 'tis good to be dead! Ha, Ha, Ha!
CREM055	Guybrush?...
CREM060	Guybrush!
CREM065	I thought I'd lost you forever. Is it really you?
CRGT070	Yes, Elaine! 
CRGT075	Umm...did you really mean what you said out there?...That I was the only man you ever loved?
CREM080	Uh...well...Yes, Guybrush, I guess I did.
CRGT090	Elaine, I'm a man of action. A swashbuckler. A rogue. A wanderer! A man who can hold his breath for ten minutes. I have no ties and no regrets. I sail with the wind and go where adventure takes me. 
CREM095	Guybrush, stop babbling.
CRGT100	Elaine, will you marry me?
CREM105	Oh, Guybrush!
CRGT115	Oh,
CRGT120	You're alive! Uh, but, how did you survive the explosion?!!
CRWY125	I was thrown clear. I'm just lucky I wasn't wearing my seat belt.
CRWY130	Wow, Elaine! That's some ring!
CREM135	Thank you, Wally. It's an engagement ring from Guybrush.
CRWY140	Hey! That looks just like that big diamond ring LeChuck had in his treasure hold.
CRWY145	You know, the one with that ghastly, disfiguring voodoo curse on it.
CRWY150	Well, I'm sure Guybrush wouldn't have given you THAT ring.
CRWY155	Anyway, I gotta be going. I hear there's a tattoo removal place on this island that's freckle-safe.
CRWY160	See ya at the wedding!
CREM165	Guybrush?!!!
CRGT170	Uhhh...
FILC180	Aaaaaargh!!!
INLC205	Fire!
INGI210	Incoming! Aaaaaaah!
INEM215	How many times do I have to tell you, LeChuck? I just don't feel that way about you.
INGT220	Elaine!
INLC225	By my congealed blood, you'll learn to love me! Sail with me and I'll make ya queen of the dead!
INEM230	I...I can't. I'm washing my hair tonight. 
INLC235	Blast be yer hair, woman! Can't you see that this salty old sea-corpse pines for your every gentle caress?
INEM240	You know...I don't think my father would approve of me dating the undead-
INEM245	And you're probably too nice a zombie-pirate for me anyway-- 
INEM250	...Let's just be friends instead. 
INLC255	Daaaaaaargh!
INEM260	(Breathy Sigh) Let's face it, LeChuck. You're an evil, foul-smelling, vile, codependent villain and that's just not what I'm looking for in a romantic relationship right now.
INLC265	Darn yer riddles, ya saucy female!
INLC270	What d'ya mean?
INSE275	Ahhh! Ohhh!
INEM280	You're a blood-thirsty monster who's already kidnapped me once, tortured my friends,...and taken from me the only man I ever loved: Guybrush Threepwood.
INSE285	Awwww...how romantic...
INSE290	Ship Ahoy!
INLC295	Threepwood?!!!
INLC300	Fish him out!
INEM305	Guybrush?!
INLC310	Guybrush Threepwood! By my gangrenous gut, I don't know how you escaped my carnival of the damned, but you won't escape the taste of my blade!
INLC315	Daaaargh!
INLC320	Ooooh. The lass has spirit! Eh.
INLC325	Throw him in the hold! I'll finish him after the battle.
INLC330	Turn loose the longboats.
INLC335	...and prepare the flaming, voodoo cannon-ball!
LRLC345	Ahhh. Another group of recruits for my army of the undead!
LRLC350	Now...how goes the search for my bride-to-be?
LRLC355	Where's Dinghy Dog?!
LRDD360	I found 'em! I found 'em! (Laugh) Hyuk, Hyuk, Hyuk! Oh, golly. Oh, gosh. Hyuk! Hyuk!That's right!
LRLC365	Where?!!!!!
LRDD370	 Uh...they're on Blood Island, sir.
LRLC375	Get them...
LCGT385	Ooooh!
LCGT390	Umm. Elaine? Are you alright?
LCEM395	Guybrush? Where...where are we?
LCGT400	You're O.K. We're on Blood Island.
LCGT405	LeChuck's ring had a terrible curse on it, but I put everything right! 
MSDD415	Hyuk! Uh...nope! Nope! She's not on Plunder Island, Captain LeChuck!
MSLC420	Then scour the seas, ya ossified rats! Hunt them down then bring 'em to me!
MSLC425	Find me Guybrush Threepwood. It's with him that ye'll find Elaine!
MSLC430	Burn down every island in the Caribbean if you have to, but bring me my bride!...And more slaw.
MSLC435	Curse the villains! They never give you enough slaw with these value meals.
NBFP440	A barrel of grog! And a chicken! Ha, ha! Look at all this stuff, mate!
NBFP445	Oh, that musta been some battle! Let's pull up anchor and make for Skull Island. King André will pay through the nose for all this loot!
NBTP450	Wait a minute! There's something else. It's...uh...it's...uh...it's some kind of footwear...
NBTP455	Hey!...Those are nice boots!
NBTP470	Aaaaah! But they're still hot! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
NBLC475	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!
NBTP480	Aaaaaaaaaaa!
OPGT485	Captain's log: Guybrush Threepwood. Lost at sea for days now. I have no crew or navigational instruments. No provisions except a half-eaten corn-dog and, unless I find water soon, I'm surely done for. Only the hope of finding my love, Elaine, keeps me going.
OPGT490	My quest for the fabulous treasure called Big Whoop has left me in this sorry state. I thought it would bring me fame and glory. Instead, it delivered me into the clutches of my enemy, the zombie-pirate LeChuck. I had thwarted his evil plot to marry Elaine and he was after revenge.
OPGT500	<Cough> Really, really thirsty now. If only I could have a small drink of fresh water, I might have the strength to sail on. 
OPGT505	Oh, but I know there's nothing but ocean for miles and miles...
OPGT510	If I could reach land, I might find water and some food. Fruit, maybe...something to fight off the scurvy and help me get my strength back. Mmmmmm...maybe some bananas...
OPGT515	Oh, why do I torture myself like this? I might as well wish for some chicken and a big mug of grog for all the good it will do me.
OPGT520	Oh, my sweet Elaine...am I cursed to starve here on this ocean...without seeing your face just one more time? Am I--
SWGT600	Van Helgen?!!
SWVH610	Haggis! Lend a hand!!
SWHM615	I'm barely holdin' on meself, mates!!
SWHM620	By God, this wind, she's the devil's own!!
SWGT625	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
SZLC630	Now, with the demon flames of this voodoo cannonball, I'll blast my significant other into the significant otherworld.  (Laugh)
SZLC635	That'll show her how much I truly care-- 
SZGT640	Ooof!
SZLC645	DAAAaarrr! 
SZEM650	Oh, no!
CAGT409	Triangulation of crossfire...that's the key!
CAGT410	I could never hit that from here...at least, not if I was acting alone.
HBGT538	Ah, Pappapisshu!
CLGT525	Oooh. Brain freeze.
LQGT445	Besides, if I want to enter the theater I can always use the stage door.
CLGT526	It says, 'Frozen Bigfoot.'
CLGT527	It says, 'Hall of Oddities.'
CLGT528	It says, 'Trixie, the giraffe-necked girl.'
CLGT529	It says, 'Shows.'
CLGT530	It says, 'Rides.'
CLGT531	It says, 'Snowcones.'
CLGT532	It says, 'Guess Yer Age 'n Weight.'

VDGT409T	And asked, `Why all this senseless fightin'?`

VDGT415T	And Puerto Pollo, your capitol city...
